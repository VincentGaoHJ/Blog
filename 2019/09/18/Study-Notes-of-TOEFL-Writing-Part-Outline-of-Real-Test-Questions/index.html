<ul>
<li><p><strong>开头</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>物联网，人们离不开 technological devices 了</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>过一段时间等功能完善了再买会比较明智 </p>
<p>Firstly, it is wise to buy the device later when its deficiencies get fixed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>新出来的产品，往往会不完善。用户多了，提问题给他们，问题解决了，手机就完美了。</p>
<p>It is because when a new technological device is available to the public for the first time, there may well be several inconspicuous imperfections existing in it. With the growing number of users reporting the problems to the manufacturers, the following version is bound to be better than its predecessor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>IPhone 4，信号不好。</p>
<p>Taking iPhone4 for example, this product suffered sharp criticism over signal-receiving problems caused by its poorly-design antenna. </p>
</li>
<li><p>等一段时间，稳定了，名扬天下了。</p>
<p>After rounds of adjustments, the later versions of iPhone4 gradually became stable in function and earned its worldwide reputation.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>新出来的产品价格普遍比较高，等一段时间后价格会回归理性。 </p>
<p>Secondly,the price of a newly launched technological device is relatively higher, which means the quality-price ratio is not satisfactory when people buy it at the very beginning. </p>
</li>
<li><p>经济学讲，上来会短缺，价格会很高。</p>
<p>According to laws of economics, when popular device is firstly brought to the market, the supply falls short of demand, which results in a higher price than its real value, but after a period of time, the price will return to a reasonable level. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Surface，上来价格很高，大家买不起。</p>
<p>For example, the initial price for Surface, a product by Microsoft, was set at around $600 that is unaffordable to most people. </p>
</li>
<li><p>三个月后，价格下降，更理性了。</p>
<p>3 month later, the price was cut down to ​300 that is much more reasonable. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>结尾</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To put it in a nutshell, I prefer to buy a technological device after many people begin to use them. As an old saying goes, good things are worth waiting. Facing a new fascinating technological device, we are advised to wait until the price comes down and the quality becomes better. </li>

<p>1）to evaluate teachers’ performance by students<br>2）to evaluate teachers’ performance by teachers<br>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>三个理由</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>学生接触老师比老师接触老师时间长，所以更能知道老师水平</li>
<li>老师应该回应学生，而不是回应同行</li>
<li>能帮老师省时间</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>开头</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A teacher is generally regarded by many an authoritative role in teaching activities and being a teacher requires solid academic ground in the subject which the teacher specializes in. Therefore, teachers’ teaching performance should be assessed by teachers, who have been trained in teaching methodology and thus are more professional in evaluating process. However, as far as I’m concerned, it is more useful for schools to collect information about teachers’ performance and allocate rewards to those who perform well based on students’ evaluations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>中间段1</strong><ul>
<li>To start off, it is more reasonable and effective if students evaluate teachers’ teaching performance. Because students are the direct receivers in everyday teaching activities. They are better acquainted with their teachers’ teaching performance either in teaching expertise or teaching styles. They can judge whether their teachers’ methods are effective for them or not in a long run. Whereas, other teachers are not able to know well the teacher’s teaching performance by attending only one demo class of the teacher being evaluated. Since a teacher’s overall performance shouldn’t and can’t be assessed merely through several class demonstrations, evaluation for teachers’ performance from their colleague teachers shouldn’t be seen as reasonable and valid enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>中间段2</strong><ul>
<li>In addition, teachers are supposed to respond to students, not to their colleagues nor supervisors. An experienced teacher should prepare teaching materials and give assignments based on students’ learning abilities. Teaching adjustment is always necessary in making lesson plan. This process, however, may conflict with the standard curriculum plan that schools assign. In this case, the teacher will probably choose to conform to the standard lesson plan to appeal to his or her peers and the school’s authority if his or her teaching performance is evaluated by them. Therefore, it is essential to design a valid evaluation system to incentivize teachers to respond to students rather than others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, evaluation through students can save a lot of time and effort for other teachers. For example, In Chinese schools, each teacher typically has to deal with over fifty students each class. Therefore, it will be a nuisance to pay detailed attention toward all other teachers on how they teach students, and this is under the assumption that they want to evaluate their peers in a fair and just manner. Since students have already spent so much time with their educators, they can easily come to conclusions on how good or bad their teachers are. In this sense, students can be more inclined to make fair evaluations compared to other teachers. </li>

<p>“Buy low, sell high” is the mantra of the stock market. Perhaps the most extreme example of this is arbitrage, the act of buying and selling goods simultaneously in different markets to gain an immediate profit. Impressive, but tricky.</p>

What action parents should take do you think will have the most positive effect on children to help them be have better like respecting and treating others kindly?</h4><p>1）limit the types of the TV programs and movies they watch</p>
<p>2）spend more time talking with children</p>
<p>3）supervise and monitor children while they are playing with their friends</p>
<p>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, for parents, sacrificing their spare time to actively and friendly communicate with their children is a more effective way.</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending more time deeply communicating with them, parents can better understand their children and exert positive guidance. Correspondingly, their children also tend to accept their suggest, or even criticism rather than roughly ignore it.</li>
<li>By comparison with the second one, the other two ways in the three options are somewhat unfriendly and compulsory, which would backfire. Generally speaking, children may develop a rebellious mentality if their parents are too strict with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, faced with children’s undesirable behavior habits, compared with mandatory measures, such as limiting the types of TV programs or movies, and monitoring their interactions with their friends, directly speaking to or chatting with them in person is a tender and amiable way and as well as more effective and less side-effect way.</p>

<p>Schools should require students to volunteer on the projects in the university’s city or hometown.</p>
<ul>
<li>参加志愿服务活动可以培养学生的<strong>社会责任感（cultivate the sense of responsibility）</strong>。因为在做志愿服务的过程中，会帮助那些需要帮助的人，或者是帮助一些机构解决问题，比如美化环境，清扫街道等，这会让学生感觉自己是社会的一份子，这可以让他们实现个人的社会价值。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的<strong>社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)</strong>。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得<strong>减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）</strong>从而帮助他们<strong>获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）</strong>。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

<li>Admittedly, working in a business of your own family do facilitate your adjustment to the company because your relatives will help you know about how the whole system work and maintain quickly. However, if viewed from another angle, this point of view seems not plausible enough for one to choose family business, because if you have favorable communication ability, one could become acquaintance with colleagues and they are willing to help too.</li>

Some people suggest it would benefit young students to be taught by different teachers.</h4><p>Do you agree with this view? Why or why not?</p>
<p><strong>老师精力有限 学生注意力难集中</strong></p>
<p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>

<p>— asking parents to help stop the students from cheating</p>
<p>— penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>— asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated”</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is <strong>stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, <strong>students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price</strong> to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can <strong>help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules</strong> whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, <strong>it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework</strong> that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>25岁太晚</strong></li>
<li><strong>所有人太多</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>所有人太多</p>
<p>A society needs a <strong>competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills.</strong> Otherwise, it will be unproductive and <em>fall behind the time</em>. However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a <strong>borderline pass</strong> than to be a success program.</p>

<p>— choose the members who have totally different ideas</p>
<p>Which would you think is more effective to work with?”</p>
<p>相同的人可以减少交流成本</p>
<p>相同的人可以一起面对困难</p>
<p>It is tempting to think that finishing a project with members who have different ideas could rise the diversity of the team, leading to a better result of the team assignment. Nevertheless, from my perspective, working with people who share similar opinions is a more effective way to achieve success.</p>
<p><strong>On the one hand, teaming up with classmates of a similar kind will reduce the cost of communication, which results from disagreements among team members.</strong> People who share the same character with each other are more likely to reach into an agreement quicker and easier since they share similar logical patterns. On the contrary, it is difficult for the whole group of students to agree with each other, which not only could cause conflicts among members but also waste a significant amount of time for each student during the process of negotiation. My roommate, for instance, once teamed up with her classmate to deliver a presentation in Marketing class. Unfortunately, she and her team member shared an entirely different value and interest. My roommate wanted to force on the finance industry and to make her PowerPoint look more professional. However, her classmate’s only attention was video games, and he insisted on making their presentation more entertain and enjoyable. Eventually, their cooperation went to a dad end. They had to do their whole work again separately a few days before the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, it is almost impossible to find a perfect time of meeting for every team member if they have different thoughts.</strong> The same kind of students is likely to have an identical lifestyle as well. It is not surprising, for example, that hard-working students usually get up early and typically do not stay up late. Nonetheless, people who enjoy night clubs and bars could not regulate themselves as strictly as other students. Taken my own experience as an example, I initially work with six people in my Business Communication class to finish homework. Some people were eager to finish it sooner while others did not want to start it until the deadline. Hard as we tried, we could only not find a proper time for everyone, and our homework was finished in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Admittedly, having a bunch of people who have different ideas could bring the team with fresh thoughts and unique insights of solving problems. Nevertheless, relatively simple schoolwork assigned by teachers, such as a presentation for English class or a Math question, is unlikely to be so complicated that so many different views and creativity are needed.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, no doubt working with people of similar mind is a more efficient method to finish a task because same people usually are more comfortable to communicate and that it will be less exhausting to arrange a suitable time for meeting for each team member.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.testbig.com/independent-toefl-writing-essays/your-teacher-assigns-project-you-and-you-can-select-members-work-0">https://www.testbig.com/independent-toefl-writing-essays/your-teacher-assigns-project-you-and-you-can-select-members-work-0</a></p>
<p><strong>First of all, working with similar people can avoid unnecessary arguments, thus promoting efficiency.</strong> Admittedly, appropriate arguments are rewarding, since they might trigger new thoughts and creative ideas. Despite these potential benefits, working with people of different ideas inevitably makes the whole team take the risks of discussing too much time to finish the assignment in time. For example, once I had a homework to conduct a survey about the purchasing power of young people. To my disappointment, my team spent almost half of the given time struggling to select a location to do the survey, which, in my opinion, was merely trifle details worth little attention and could be skipped if working with people of similar thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, mistakes are common in teamwork, even in the team consisting of people with similar thoughts. However, mistakes may be more destructive in the team composed of people with different thoughts.</strong> Imagine a mission not going smoothly as planned, those whose ideas were ignored at the very beginning would make a lot of complaints. <em>Chances are that</em> they might claim that it would be better if their original suggestions were considered. These sorts of complaints are extremely detrimental, since they would spark a situation where members in the team don’t trust one another. On the contrary, if the team is made up of people of similar thoughts, they would possibly stand together firmly and <strong>strive to</strong> address the problem.</p>

<p>政府做的一些指导也没有什么用</p>
<p>Currently, living in a fast-paced society, there is an increasing number of city dwellers suffering from the pressure generated from the excessive workload, consequently, majorities of city dwellers, especially those white-collar, are enslaved by diversified diseases, like cervical diseases, cardiovascular diseases and so on.</p>
<p><strong>To begin with, governments have done little in arousing public’s awareness to develop a healthy diet.</strong> That’s why bad eating habits are ubiquitous around us. For instance, fast food restaurants like McDonald’s are always crowded where junk food is served, ranging from burgers, French Fries to cola which are high in fat and sugar. People can easily gain weight if eating too much of that. Besides, every time I visit my grandmother’s home, she treats me a full table with delicious dishes, like braised pork, steamed beef and roast mutton but no vegetables. Although meat in Chinese tradition shows hospitality, to some degree, it indicates my grandmother’s lack of awareness about what a balanced diet is. Based on such prevalent phenomena, some practical approaches should be implemented by governments to increase people’s motivation to eat healthily, such as printing some booklets with tips of how to eat healthily and foods containing good nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>The government’s guidelines are vague, though nutritional advice generally isn’t.</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Sherman, a medical school professor and biochemist at Georgetown University, points to the guidelines’ heavy influence on what foods and serving sizes are included in the national school lunch program, as well as what products can be purchased using benefits from the Women, Infants and Children and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs.</p>
<p>Still, he said, the government has struggled over the years to present the guidelines in a way that they are easily understandable and usable, creating a gray area filled in by an “industry of experts” who “interpret, critique, rephrase or reimagine the guidelines,” making them particularly difficult to follow in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>And this is despite the fact that the guidelines have not changed much since the government first began offering nutrition advice many decades ago. The heart of the message has mostly remained that we should eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and limit our consumption of meat, sugar and salt intake — though the wording has varied.</p>
<p>“I think the average person would have a very difficult time just making sense of it,” Sherman told The Huffington Post. “It’s difficult to go shopping with the guidelines in your hand and do meal planning.”</p>

<p><strong>老师精力有限 学生注意力难集中</strong></p>
<p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>

<p>-penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>-asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated”</p>
<p>Which of the following do you think is the most efficient way to stop?</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>A society needs a competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills. Otherwise, it will be unproductive and fall behind the time. However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a borderline pass than to be a success program.</p>

What they learn in this period will become a huge factor that determining their whole life to a great extent. In order to better use this golden time, some education institution advocate that students are supposed to learn as many subjects as possible at this time. However, I don’t think it is a smart move to do so. Instead, studying three or four subjects at a time would serve them better.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, only three or four subjects at a time will ensure that students have enough time and energy for each of subjects to make further research to gain the thorough and deep understanding.</li>
<li>And besides, when students are allow to choose three or four subjects at a time based on their own interest, they would perform better without under the huge amount of mental pressure.</li>
<li>What can not be denied is that there are such versatile geniuses who can easily cope with many subjects at one time without any difficulty. However, only a small fraction of students have this talent. For the most of the high school students, only pursue the quantity of subjects not quality will definitely backfire. </li>

<p>2) help people who cannot afford to build or rent a home to build a house</p>
<p>3) visit and assist elderly people with daily tasks</p>
<p>The student club is the critical constituent part of a high educated society, because it is the tower of strength to link the university to the community. The highest standard for a student club is serving the community well and at the same time could improve the students ability.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, by designing and constructing a building, the students from different majors will learn to transfer their academic knowledge to practice.</li>
<li>And besides, offering primary school students help in reading and mathematics and taking care of the elder are not easy for students in universities and will take a lot of time of their prime time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, since the main purpose of students to attend this university club is to improve themselves and at the same time serve the community. So building houses is a project that can better yield tangible results.</p>

Which idea do you support?</h4><p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to children’s education, we are undergoing a stage where children’s extra-curriculum are playing significant role. Thus, this phenomenon triggers an grave concern about whether teenagers should take part in this kind of activities such as musical and sports. In my opinion, it is very necessary for teenagers to be engaged in this variety activities. And my reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, getting involved in more activities can be conducive to the well-rounded development of students. <ul>
<li>It is self-evident that different activities can equip participants with various skills and abilities.<ul>
<li>To illustrate this point of view, students attending musical concerts can learn how to appreciate the melodies and concertos of musical masterpieces and thus improve their aesthetic capability.</li>
<li>Similarly, the team sports will help students cultivate a sense of cooperation and collective sense of honor.</li>
<li>So, after having obtained the above skills, students will definitely can develop in an all-rounded way, with the result if becoming more competitive than others in the society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In contrast, specializing in only one kind of activity is a totally different picture. This kind of cultivation sometimes will backfire. It means that, if one is only be fostered in one field, his future development will face potential obstacles and difficulties. And the underlying reason is that the more and more complicated modern life necessitate the comprehensive prerequisite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, taking part in many after-class activities can do better job in helping students find what they are really interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, we can draw a conclusion that it is a wiser move for students to attend multiple activities in different fields, in order to obtain a holistic development and find what fascinate them most.</p>

Which one of the following do you think is the most important for the nation’s government to take to protect the environment.</h4><p>1) Fund the research to develop environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>
<p>2) Preserve the natural places like forests and protect the animals that live there.</p>
<p>3) Enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water by large companies.</p>
<p>Taking a panoramic view of human history, we can readily find that the natural environment plays and enormously important role in determining the future of each and every country.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, spending money in developing new energy which is friendly to environment can radically solve the various problems triggered by environment changes.<ul>
<li>影响工业</li>
<li>影响环境同样影响人 respiratory disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, there are conspicuous limitation of the other two options, because both of them will bring some notable side-effect which possibly will backfire.<ul>
<li>保护动物只能暂时解决问题，不是长远之计</li>
<li>并不是所有国家都有实力不排放并且保持经济增长，保护环境损失经济，同样不可取</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that funding research of environmental friendly energy will more preferable, because not only it is the pragmatic key  to solving the environmental problems comprehensively, but also has little side-effect.</p>

It is considering two plans:</h4><p>1) Choose a small group of excellent teachers; these teachers will attend a class led by an expert for additional training in how to teach effectively, and they will then come back to their schools and provide that training for other teachers in school.</p>
<p>2) Provide additional training in teaching effectively for high school teachers,using online material that each teacher will study individually. </p>
<p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to the education, will are on the stage that improving the teachers skill become a pressing matter of the moment. Thus, this kind of situation triggers a grave concern about which way to improve teacher’s skill is pragmatic and feasible. In my opinion, I incline to state that the best approach to enhance training of teachers is to provide every teacher with the training courses through the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, face-to-face training courses could only serve a small scale of teachers and information passed on by them to other teachers might be incomplete or even worse because of inattention or forgetfulness, beside, these group of teacher also need time to absorb what they have learned from the courses.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the online training course is more convenient and more practical for teachers.</li>
<li>Some educational experts claim that face-to-face training is superior to online course because they allow all the attendee to discuss afterwards. However , if viewed from another angle, actually, online course is capable of this also.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from what has been discussed above, we can safely reach the conclusion that it is more advisable to provide training to all the teacher online since it is more pragmatic and more effective than face-to-face training provided bu experts.</p>

<p>2) penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>3) asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>Friendship is a huge constituent part of a wonderful life, and everyone long for a long-lasting time of relationship with friends. So, this kind of aspiration triggers an interesting discussion about what is the most significant factor in determining the last time of friendship. In my opinion, I incline to state that the common interest is the vital key to a long lasting relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, having the same interests is the basic guarantee to have mutual interest topic to talk to each other, which definitely will lead to many memorable experiences.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it seems that helping others in emergency and mutual trust are also related to the lasting time of friendship. But the fact is both of them are not the fundamental  reason for this, instead, they are the superficial causes. Beyond these superficial causes, the fundamental cause could trace back to the common interest. Because spending a lot of time together is the prerequisite to a well developed friendship which lead to further help in emergency and mutual trust. From this point of view, helping each other when one is in emergency and trusting each other completely are the result of a long lasting friendship, not the factor of the lasting time of the friendship.</li>

Do you think it is effective？Why or why not？</h4><p>A society needs a competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills. Otherwise, it will be unproductive and fall behind the time. However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a borderline pass than to be a success program.</p>

It is common that young people are easy to get excited with the dream and impulsively pursuing the dream. However, I insist that people should always focus on the realistic goals. My reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ambitious goal may be a great rallying cry, but it is hard to sustain the motivation of pursuing one over a long time, because eventually you will get tired and realize that the goal is to hard to reach and finally you will stop striving for it and the process will slide into stagnant.</li>
<li>Achievable and realistic goals are good indication of a huge plan, and it can provide satisfaction and motivation when one achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that achievable goals are therefore superior to ones which are too extreme huge because they are not only offer you a distinct record of the process you have made towards a larger plan, but also provide the motivation which could prevent you from sliding into stagnant. </p>

<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）从而帮助他们获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

Some people suggest it would benefit young students to be taught by different teachers. Do you agree with this view? Why or why not?</h4><p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>
