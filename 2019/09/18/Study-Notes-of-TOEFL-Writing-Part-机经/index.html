What’s your opinion？"></a>- Parents give their children weekly money to buy whatever they want. Some people think this can cause bad habits and ideas about money in children. Others think the opposite. What’s your opinion？</h4><ul>
<li>To start with, giving children weekly money as reward is conducive to motivate them to study hard.</li>
<li>Besides, financial thinking as an important skill is useful to the modern society, meaning that parents ought to teach the children how to manage their own money.</li>
<li>However, it is unwise to give too much money once a time when children get a good grade, since that will miss lead the children to be money oriented. But the goal is to encourage them to work hard and put a little pressure on them and at the same time make sure they are not going to be luxury. I will be fun to do so.</li>

<li>To start with, encouraging children to do their own their independently is conducive to cultivating self-confidence.</li>
<li>Besides, the best way to teach children responsibility is to encourage them to finish tasks on their own.</li>
<li>Admittedly, in some cases, parents should not hesitate to help their children due to the consideration of safety.</li>

<ul>
<li>To start with, to work in an irrelevant company gives you a lot of freedom of choice since personal emotions and family relationship will not be taken into consideration when you make decisions.</li>
<li>And besides, working for a business owned by strangers provides you a bunch of chances to expanding your social network instead of working with a lot of relatives.</li>
<li>Admittedly, working in a business of your own family do facilitate your adjustment to the company because your relatives will help you know about how the whole system work and maintain quickly. However, if viewed from another angle, this point of view seems not plausible enough for one to choose family business, because if you have favorable communication ability, one could become acquaintance with colleagues and they are willing to help too.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, facing the choice between working in family business and competing independently in job market, people should opt for the latter one.</p>

What action parents should take do you think will have the most positive effect on children to help them be have better like respecting and treating others kindly?</h4><p>1) Limit the types of the TV programs and movies they watch</p>
<p>2) Spend more time talking with children</p>
<p>3) Supervise and monitor children while they are playing with their friends</p>
<p>In my opinion, for parents, sacrificing their spare time to actively and friendly communicate with their children is a more effective way.</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending more time deeply communicating with them, parents can better understand their children and exert positive guidance. Correspondingly, their children also tend to accept their suggest, or even criticism rather than roughly ignore it.</li>
<li>By comparison with the second one, the other two ways in the three options are somewhat unfriendly and compulsory, which would backfire. </li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, faced with children’s undesirable behavior habits, compared with mandatory measures, such as limiting the types of TV programs or movies, and monitoring their interactions with their friends, directly speaking to or chatting with them in person is a tender and amiable way and as well as more effective and less side-effect way.</p>

What they learn in this period will become a huge factor that determining their whole life to a great extent. In order to better use this golden time, some education institution advocate that students are supposed to learn as many subjects as possible at this time. However, I don’t think it is a smart move to do so. Instead, studying three or four subjects at a time would serve them better.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, only three or four subjects at a time will ensure that students have enough time and energy for each of subjects to make further research to gain the thorough and deep understanding.</li>
<li>And besides, when students are allow to choose three or four subjects at a time based on their own interest, they would perform better without under the huge amount of mental pressure.</li>
<li>What can not be denied is that there are such versatile geniuses who can easily cope with many subjects at one time without any difficulty. However, only a small fraction of students have this talent. For the most of the high school students, only pursue the quantity of subjects not quality will definitely backfire. </li>

<p>2) help people who cannot afford to build or rent a home to build a house</p>
<p>3) visit and assist elderly people with daily tasks</p>
<p>The student club is the critical constituent part of a high educated society, because it is the tower of strength to link the university to the community. The highest standard for a student club is serving the community well and at the same time could improve the students ability.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, by designing and constructing a building, the students from different majors will learn to transfer their academic knowledge to practice.</li>
<li>And besides, offering primary school students help in reading and mathematics and taking care of the elder are not easy for students in universities and will take a lot of time of their prime time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, since the main purpose of students to attend this university club is to improve themselves and at the same time serve the community. So building houses is a project that can better yield tangible results.</p>

Which idea do you support?"></a>- Some teenagers take part in kinds of activities,such as musical classes,sports classes and so on,but others only focus on one activity which is important to them. Which idea do you support?</h4><p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to children’s education, we are undergoing a stage where children’s extra-curriculum are playing significant role. Thus, this phenomenon triggers an grave concern about whether teenagers should take part in this kind of activities such as musical and sports. In my opinion, it is very necessary for teenagers to be engaged in this variety activities. And my reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, getting involved in more activities can be conducive to the well-rounded development of students. <ul>
<li>It is self-evident that different activities can equip participants with various skills and abilities.<ul>
<li>To illustrate this point of view, students attending musical concerts can learn how to appreciate the melodies and concertos of musical masterpieces and thus improve their aesthetic capability.</li>
<li>Similarly, the team sports will help students cultivate a sense of cooperation and collective sense of honor.</li>
<li>So, after having obtained the above skills, students will definitely can develop in an all-rounded way, with the result if becoming more competitive than others in the society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In contrast, specializing in only one kind of activity is a totally different picture. This kind of cultivation sometimes will backfire. It means that, if one is only be fostered in one field, his future development will face potential obstacles and difficulties. And the underlying reason is that the more and more complicated modern life necessitate the comprehensive prerequisite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, taking part in many after-class activities can do better job in helping students find what they are really interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, we can draw a conclusion that it is a wiser move for students to attend multiple activities in different fields, in order to obtain a holistic development and find what fascinate them most.</p>

Which one of the following do you think is the most important for the nation’s government to take to protect the environment.</h4><p>1) Fund the research to develop environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>
<p>2) Preserve the natural places like forests and protect the animals that live there.</p>
<p>3) Enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water by large companies.</p>
<p>Taking a panoramic view of human history, we can readily find that the natural environment plays and enormously important role in determining the future of each and every country.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, spending money in developing new energy which is friendly to environment can radically solve the various problems triggered by environment changes.<ul>
<li>影响工业</li>
<li>影响环境同样影响人 respiratory disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, there are conspicuous limitation of the other two options, because both of them will bring some notable side-effect which possibly will backfire.<ul>
<li>保护动物只能暂时解决问题，不是长远之计</li>
<li>并不是所有国家都有实力不排放并且保持经济增长，保护环境损失经济，同样不可取</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that funding research of environmental friendly energy will more preferable, because not only it is the pragmatic key  to solving the environmental problems comprehensively, but also has little side-effect.</p>

It is considering two plans:"></a>- A city wants to help teachers of its high school students (age 14-18)improve their teaching. It is considering two plans:</h4><p>1) Choose a small group of excellent teachers; these teachers will attend a class led by an expert for additional training in how to teach effectively, and they will then come back to their schools and provide that training for other teachers in school.</p>
<p>2) Provide additional training in teaching effectively for high school teachers,using online material that each teacher will study individually. </p>
<p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to the education, will are on the stage that improving the teachers skill become a pressing matter of the moment. Thus, this kind of situation triggers a grave concern about which way to improve teacher’s skill is pragmatic and feasible. In my opinion, I incline to state that the best approach to enhance training of teachers is to provide every teacher with the training courses through the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, face-to-face training courses could only serve a small scale of teachers and information passed on by them to other teachers might be incomplete or even worse because of inattention or forgetfulness, beside, these group of teacher also need time to absorb what they have learned from the courses.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the online training course is more convenient and more practical for teachers.</li>
<li>Some educational experts claim that face-to-face training is superior to online course because they allow all the attendee to discuss afterwards. However , if viewed from another angle, actually, online course is capable of this also.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from what has been discussed above, we can safely reach the conclusion that it is more advisable to provide training to all the teacher online since it is more pragmatic and more effective than face-to-face training provided bu experts.</p>

Which of the following do you think is the most efficient way to stop?</h4><p>1) asking parents to help stop the students from cheating</p>
<p>2) penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>3) asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>2) have the same interests</p>
<p>3) trust each other completely</p>
<p>Friendship is a huge constituent part of a wonderful life, and everyone long for a long-lasting time of relationship with friends. So, this kind of aspiration triggers an interesting discussion about what is the most significant factor in determining the last time of friendship. In my opinion, I incline to state that the common interest is the vital key to a long lasting relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, having the same interests is the basic guarantee to have mutual interest topic to talk to each other, which definitely will lead to many memorable experiences.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it seems that helping others in emergency and mutual trust are also related to the lasting time of friendship. But the fact is both of them are not the fundamental  reason for this, instead, they are the superficial causes. Beyond these superficial causes, the fundamental cause could trace back to the common interest. Because spending a lot of time together is the prerequisite to a well developed friendship which lead to further help in emergency and mutual trust. From this point of view, helping each other when one is in emergency and trusting each other completely are the result of a long lasting friendship, not the factor of the lasting time of the friendship.</li>

Do you think it is effective？Why or why not？</h4><p>A society needs a competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills. Otherwise, it will be unproductive and fall behind the time. However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a borderline pass than to be a success program.</p>

Which do you think is better and why?</h4><p>In all ages, human never give up on discussing the controversy that about whether to pursue ambitious dreams or to focus on realistic goals. It is common that young people are easy to get excited with the dream and impulsively pursuing the dream. However, I insist that people should always focus on the realistic goals. My reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ambitious goal may be a great rallying cry, but it is hard to sustain the motivation of pursuing one over a long time, because eventually you will get tired and realize that the goal is to hard to reach and finally you will stop striving for it and the process will slide into stagnant.</li>
<li>Achievable and realistic goals are good indication of a huge plan, and it can provide satisfaction and motivation when one achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that achievable goals are therefore superior to ones which are too extreme huge because they are not only offer you a distinct record of the process you have made towards a larger plan, but also provide the motivation which could prevent you from sliding into stagnant. </p>

<li>参加志愿服务活动可以培养学生的社会责任感（cultivate the sense of responsibility）。因为在做志愿服务的过程中，会帮助那些需要帮助的人，或者是帮助一些机构解决问题，比如美化环境，清扫街道等，这会让学生感觉自己是社会的一份子，这可以让他们实现个人的社会价值。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）从而帮助他们获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
