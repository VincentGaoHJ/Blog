<h2 id="TASK-1-10-10"><a href="#TASK-1-10-10" class="headerlink" title="TASK 1 - 10.10"></a>TASK 1 - 10.10</h2><h4 id="【1】When-students-have-questions-about-an-assignment-for-class-some-prefer-to-ask-the-professor-for-help-Others-prefer-to-ask-other-students-in-the-class-for-help-understanding-the-assignment"><a href="#【1】When-students-have-questions-about-an-assignment-for-class-some-prefer-to-ask-the-professor-for-help-Others-prefer-to-ask-other-students-in-the-class-for-help-understanding-the-assignment" class="headerlink" title="【1】When students have questions about an assignment for class, some prefer to ask the professor for help. Others prefer to ask other students in the class for help understanding the assignment."></a>【1】When students have questions about an assignment for class, some prefer to ask the professor for help. Others prefer to ask other students in the class for help understanding the assignment.</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Explain why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>While, I prefer to go</strong> ask the professor directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>This is because,</strong> assignments are designed and issued by the professor. So his opinion and interpretation is the most precise one and without any misinterpretation. So, it is a efficient approach to get to better understand the assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>And besides,</strong> students’ understanding also could have some misunderstanding even if they say that they are totally understand what the professor want to say. So, if you just reach an agreement with your classmates, doesn’t mean that you have the right understanding of the assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Therefore, I prefer to ask professor straightforward.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【2】Should-students-be-required-to-evaluate-their-professors-at-the-end-of-the-semester"><a href="#【2】Should-students-be-required-to-evaluate-their-professors-at-the-end-of-the-semester" class="headerlink" title="【2】Should students be required to evaluate their professors at the end of the semester?"></a>【2】Should students be required to evaluate their professors at the end of the semester?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer that</strong> students should not be required to evaluate their professors at the and of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> at the end to the semester, every students will get a score from their professor according to their performance. But students sometimes will evaluate their professor just according to their own score but not according to their professor’s own performance. That is not fair to the professor. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> students have the right not to evaluate any professor. So, the university should give students the chance to evaluate the professor and at the same time not to ask everyone to evaluate for obligation.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer no to required all students to evaluate the professors.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【3】Do-you-think-it’s-necessary-for-children’s-growth-for-them-to-live-far-away-from-home-and-stay-with-relatives-or-friends-during-school-breaks"><a href="#【3】Do-you-think-it’s-necessary-for-children’s-growth-for-them-to-live-far-away-from-home-and-stay-with-relatives-or-friends-during-school-breaks" class="headerlink" title="【3】Do you think it’s necessary for children’s growth for them to live far away from home and stay with relatives or friends during school breaks?"></a>【3】Do you think it’s necessary for children’s growth for them to live far away from home and stay with relatives or friends during school breaks?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to say</strong> it is not necessary for children to live far away from home during the school breaks.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> their classmates are their friends and they already spend a lot of time together, you know, they spend 8 hour a day and 5 days a week. And even hang out with other friends at night. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> students are really exhausted by the campus life, because of tons of works and projects and reports. So the school break is the best time for them to relax if they can stay at home all day long.</li>
<li><strong>And another thing that matters is that,</strong> for some students, the school break is the only time that they can spend with their parents.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think it’s not necessary for children to live far away from home during school breaks.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>While, I would prefer to</strong> start a project as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> if we start a project as early as possible, and you will stand a fair chance to end this project as early as possible. Because the total time you need to complete the project is constant and not related to the time you start. And you could start the next project immediately, so, you will go to the track of positive circulation, promote the over all efficiency of working.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> if you start a project early, then you have the chance to polish it to the perfect and increase the odds of the real life success.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I stand for the law that always start a project as early as possible.</strong> </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> study for exam in the day. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> You know, I am a morning guy, so, when I get up early, like 6 o’clock or 7 o’clock, I can just get to work immediately. And in the early morning, my mind is really sharp and I can better concentrate on my tasks. And productivity and inventiveness will spring up.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> when I study in the night, I sometimes will pull an all-nighter, and it is definitely detrimental to our body and physical health.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to study in the day rather than in the night.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【6】Some-students-prefer-to-do-things-which-they-are-good-at-Some-students-force-themselves-to-do-what-they-are-not-good-at"><a href="#【6】Some-students-prefer-to-do-things-which-they-are-good-at-Some-students-force-themselves-to-do-what-they-are-not-good-at" class="headerlink" title="【6】Some students prefer to do things which they are good at. Some students force themselves to do what they are not good at?"></a>【6】Some students prefer to do things which they are good at. Some students force themselves to do what they are not good at?</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> force myself to do what I am not good at.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> doing something that I am not good at can help me to overcome the fear of unknown and get the gut to step out of the comfort zone. That is definitely crucial for one to abroad the horizon and expand the scope of knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> doing something that you don’t good at can force you to ask others for help. And during this learning process, you can make a great number of friends which are proficient at diverse fields. And such a large interpersonal network is a valuable asset in life (will be a great treasure for the rest of your life).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【7】Do-you-agree-or-disagree-that-to-succeed-we-need-to-make-enemies"><a href="#【7】Do-you-agree-or-disagree-that-to-succeed-we-need-to-make-enemies" class="headerlink" title="【7】Do you agree or disagree that to succeed we need to make enemies?"></a>【7】Do you agree or disagree that to succeed we need to make enemies?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I can not agree that</strong> to succeed we need to make enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Admittedly</strong>, it is true that we will encounter tons of enemies in order to succeed, but it does not mean that we need to make enemies, especially we are already have a lot of enemies.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the best strategy to succeed is to make friends of an enemy. Which means if you can convert an powerful enemy into friends, that will make you ever stronger and even more closer to the success.</li>
<li><strong>Let’s look at the</strong> Los Angeles Lakers in NBA. Kobe Bryant &amp; Shaquille O’Neal , they are two best players in the whole association. And there is no need for them to be enemy if they want the championship. And when O’Neal left the Lakers, It’s much harder for Kobe to win the championship. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I do not agree that we need to make enemies.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While I definitely agree that</strong> good teachers should admit they mistakes or don’t know something.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> every human being will make mistakes, and teacher is no exception. But it is OK to make mistakes, as long as we apologize with sincere attitude, and promise we will never make that mistake again.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong>  Admitting there is something that we don’t know is a excellent chance for teacher to tell  students that knowledge is boundless and infinite and no body is too old to study.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【9】Do-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-statement-that-people-should-be-fined-for-checking-or-looking-at-their-cellphones-when-walking-in-streets-and-crossing-roads"><a href="#【9】Do-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-statement-that-people-should-be-fined-for-checking-or-looking-at-their-cellphones-when-walking-in-streets-and-crossing-roads" class="headerlink" title="【9】Do you agree or disagree with the statement that people should be fined for checking or looking at their cellphones when walking in streets and crossing roads?"></a>【9】Do you agree or disagree with the statement that people should be fined for checking or looking at their cellphones when walking in streets and crossing roads?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I totally not agree that</strong> it’s fine for checking cellphone when crossing roads.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it is definitely a dangerous conduct, because once we dive into our cellphones, there is no chance to obverse the road and spot the dangerous situation and keep away from it. So, the right thing we should do when crossing roads is to slow our speed and check around meticulously.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> if we do so, pedestrians who walking aside will stand a fair chance to emulate our wrong behavior, and it is also perilous for them not to looking at the road, and probably will cause traffic accident.</li>

Please give specific details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> libraries will not disappear, even if more and more people reading in cell phones.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong>, there are still many people are willing to read in paper materials, because paper material has an advantage that could not be replaced by electronic format which is that reading in paper material are more likely to be in progress of deep reading which is immersed in the book.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> libraries also provide all the citizens a quite place to read, if I want to concentrate on my work better at weekend, I could choose to go to city library.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think the libraries will no disappear in the future.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I totally agree that</strong> library computer should be banned from accessing social media websites. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the main goal of library computer is to access some specific database that only library have the authority to access. For the sake of safety, the computer shouldn’t be able to connect both specific database and social media in the same time.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> get away from social media can help students to concentrate on their tasks so that his efficiency will be improved dramatically.</li>

This course will be free for them and they will not receive feedback or grades about their papers.</h4><p> Do you think this is a good program and why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I think this is</strong> really a excellent program.</li>
<li><strong>You know,</strong> in my country, there are numerous people are not allow to attend university to study even if they will want to study instead of getting a master degree, this project give them a chance to study in university, and they will be thankful.</li>
<li><strong>And because</strong> there is no need to give them feedback or grades, so teachers in university will not be required to add more work. They just need to go to the classroom with more people.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I am not agree that</strong> students should take additional courses to get credits more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> students are required to attend three or four courses every semester, and assignment of them are already choking high, so there is no time for them to take the additional courses.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> provided that a student take additional courses so as to get more credits. He stands a fair chance never learn any subject well, because they have to squeeze their time from full schedule, and hardly be full of vigor.</li>

Others prefer to wait and listen to others’ opinions before giving their own.</h4><p>Which one do you think is better?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I definitely will</strong> wait and listen to others’ opinions before giving my own.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong> listening is a excellent chance for everyone to learn from others. If we just talk and talk all the time, there is no chance for us to learn something new. But if we always listen to others’ opinions, we will end up learning numerous ideas that differs from ours’.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> wait and listen before talk is a good way to show respect. And it is a decent conduct to communicate with others. And if you do so, you will stand a fair chance to build up a better relationship. </li>

<li><strong>While, I definitely agree that</strong> children should learn to draw or paint.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> painting and drawing is an excellent way for kids to express themselves. You know, children sometimes can not present their feeling well using language due to the lack to vocabulary. So painting give them another way to better express and communicate.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> learning to painting can foster them ability to concentrate on one thing in a relatively long time. And this ability will help them occupy a vantage point in fierce competition in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I will definitely</strong> choose to have a telephone interview.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> time is precious and should not be wasted. If I have to go to the company to have a face to face interview, I have to squander a large amount of time on the commute. That is not cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> I can still distinctly and clearly express my opinion in a telephone interview and try hard not to cause misinterpretations. So, nothing is lost and detrimental for my to take a telephone interview instead of a face to face interview.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I am not agree that</strong> business conferences should meet in person instead of using video calls.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> using video calls is an excellent way for everyone to improve their efficiency. You know, we don’t have to squander our precious time in the travel to the company.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> high technology furnish us with the ability to conduct the high quality video calls. So there is no chance for me not to use it. So I by no means will not to use it. So on no account will I not to use it.</li>

<li><strong>While, I really do not agree that</strong> we only help our friend when they ask for help.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> as a truly friends, we should help our friends when they need help, not when they only ask for help. Because, sometimes, they do need help and are willing to be help, but they are just shy or ashamed of being helped.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> even if they don’t need out help, they can still better and quicker tackle the problem under our help.</li>

<li><strong>While, I really to not agree that</strong> children will become more aggressive in the future just because they do sports at a young age.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> doing sports is an excellent conduct for everyone to release their aggressive feeling or thinking in a proper way, as well as a legitimate way. It is not the way to spark up one’s aggressive feeling.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> it is just the other way around, if one can unleash their dissatisfaction and some aggressive thoughts, he will stand a fair chance to tackle the quandaries in a more amiable and genial way.</li>

Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> universities should wait until the second or the third year before students deciding to choose a major field.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the university students should be cultivated by a all-rounded way, if a student choose a major field as soon as he enter the university, he would probably directly dive into one direction and just ignore the others, it is not a very wise choice.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> delay the time to decide the major allow students to find their own interest, like, they can sign up a variety field of class and cautiously choose the major afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to say universities should wait until the second or later.</strong></li>

<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the time saved can be used to sleep well, which is conducive to better concentrate during the daytime, <strong>you know</strong> my brain is sharper and can understand what professor says quickly.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personally, I agree that</strong> children born with talent should be treated in a different way. </li>
<li><strong>Because</strong> they are the potential experts in various fields in the future, so they should be put together in a specific institute for special training, which will inspire their potential to the best, thus people can make fully use of it in the hope of making breakthroughs in some fields. </li>
<li>I remember that my younger cousin showed a talent in drawing when he was little, so his father, sent him to a school that focus on enhancing the ability of painting. Now he become a famous designer and has created some brilliant projects.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make friends with people who are of the same age.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we possibly have the same schedule and we will spend a lot of time together, you know, we are going to the same school, taking the almost the same curriculum, so we almost spend 8 hours a day. That will give us more time to communicate with each other, and get to better know each other.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> libraries will not disappear, even if more and more people reading in cell phones.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong>, there are still many people are willing to read in paper materials, because paper material has an advantage that could not be replaced by electronic format which is that reading in paper material are more likely to be in progress of deep reading which is immersed in the book.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> libraries also provide all the citizens a quite place to read, if I want to concentrate on my work better at weekend, I could choose to go to city library.</li>

<li><strong>This is because,</strong> teamwork in sports is so important that no one can just win without an excellent cooperation with teammates. </li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> members of a football team need to cooperate to successfully perform a play, whether it be a running play or a passing play. Without all involved in the play working together to make the play happen, the other team could wind up in an ultimate victory.</li>

<p><strong>While, I would like to</strong> play inside our house.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> playing inside the house is more safe for everyone, we don’t need to worry about being stolen or robbed, and if somebody left something, it is more likely to get back. And there is little air pollution inside the house.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> I like to play inside because it is more comfortable. You know, there is no need to be well-dressed and have to wear the jacket and tie. We could dressed informal and suit ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> elders should not take risks and participate in adventurous.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> they have to take the safely into consideration, maybe safety is the prime consider for them. Because, compare with the young man, doing the same adventure is more risky for the elders because of their physical status are more fragile and more likely to cause physical deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> my grandpa have a slight cardiac disease, although it is not a big deal, doctor suggest him not to do the strenuous exercises because life always comes first.</p>

<p><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make a phone call directly.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> phone calls is more directly and efficient than sending messages. If you want to communicate with or get informations from someone, you could just call them and you will get the answer and whatever you what as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> making phone call can reduce the loss of information and misunderstanding. Because, other can quickly find your misunderstanding and misstatement and correct you during the dialogue in a phone call.</p>

<li><strong>While,</strong> when I disagree with my friends or family, I tend to let them keep their own opinion.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we are different person with different background, we could not totally agree with each other on everything. So, if we try hard to convince others, we may often slide into drastic argument or even fierce fight, and sometimes end up with nothing. </li>
<li><strong>And as for me,</strong> I think distinctly express my opinion is important, but getting involved in an argument which meant to convince others are meaningless and just the waste of time.</li>

Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> we should not discuss about the celebrities’ private activities.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> their private activities are none of my business, and their private activities are undoubtedly their privacy, and paying too much attention to their privacy will possibly cross the line and break the law.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> staying out of their personal life can help me better focus on their works. You know, when I watch a movie I really want to do deep in to the character they play not be entangled by their anecdotes.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I agree that we shouldn’t pay any attention to their private activities.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> students learn more effectively through doing other activities such as subject report.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> these kind of report or papers will give us a chance to deeply understanding the field or subject in a thorough and well-rounded way. But taking exams will limit us to study some key point which gonna be tested and ignore the others. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> completing a project will allow us to study under less pressure than the exams. And a relaxation and happiness will help us to enjoy the research which lead to high efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to do other activities than exams.</strong></li>
