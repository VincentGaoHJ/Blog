Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> universities should wait until the second or the third year before students deciding to choose a major field.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the university students should be cultivated by a all-rounded way, if a student choose a major field as soon as he enter the university, he would probably directly dive into one direction and just ignore the others, it is not a very wise choice.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> delay the time to decide the major allow students to find their own interest, like, they can sign up a variety field of class and cautiously choose the major afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to say universities should wait until the second or later.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>While, I do prefer</strong> they inform me before their coming.</li>
<li><strong>This is because, as for me,</strong> I can better prepare myself, you know, I can just get dressed, get ready for snacks, and then clean the house if I have time, just before their coming.</li>
<li><strong>And besides, as for them,</strong> informing me before visit can help them to check if I am home. Because sometimes I will not stay at home all day, so informing before coming can know whether I am home, and if I am not home, their can take a rain check.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to be informed before anyone comes my home.</strong> </li>

Explain why. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to choose</strong> the apartment which is near the campus.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it can help me to save my time. <strong>You know,</strong> if I live far way from school, I will spend  lot of time on the way to school. <strong>And</strong>, I if live near the school, I will have a lot of time to do whatever I want.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the time saved can be used to sleep well, which is conducive to better concentrate during the daytime, <strong>you know</strong> my brain is sharper and can understand what professor says quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to choose the apartment near to school.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personally, I agree that</strong> children born with talent should be treated in a different way. </li>
<li><strong>Because</strong> they are the potential experts in various fields in the future, so they should be put together in a specific institute for special training, which will inspire their potential to the best, thus people can make fully use of it in the hope of making breakthroughs in some fields. </li>
<li>I remember that my younger cousin showed a talent in drawing when he was little, so his father, sent him to a school that focus on enhancing the ability of painting. Now he become a famous designer and has created some brilliant projects.</li>

Other people prefer to make friends with people who are of different ages."></a>【5】Some people prefer to make friends with people who are of the same age. Other people prefer to make friends with people who are of different ages.</h4><p>Which one do you prefer? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make friends with people who are of the same age.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we possibly have the same schedule and we will spend a lot of time together, you know, we are going to the same school, taking the almost the same curriculum, so we almost spend 8 hours a day. That will give us more time to communicate with each other, and get to better know each other.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> we don’t have the generation gap, and we are more easier to understand each other and provide better and pragmatic advises.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to make friends with people who are of the same age.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I really do not agree that</strong> we only help our friend when they ask for help.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> as a truly friends, we should help our friends when they need help, not when they only ask for help. Because, sometimes, they do need help and are willing to be help, but they are just shy or ashamed of being help.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> even if they don’t need out help, they can still better and quicker solve the problem under our help.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I don’t agree that we only should offer a helping hand when they ask for help.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> libraries will not disappear, even if more and more people reading in cell phones.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong>, there are still many people are willing to read in paper materials, because paper material has an advantage that could not be replaced by electronic format which is that reading in paper material are more likely to be in progress of deep reading which is immersed in the book.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> libraries also provide all the citizens a quite place to read, if I want to concentrate on my work better at weekend, I could choose to go to city library.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think the libraries will no disappear in the future.</strong></li>

Would you prefer to go shopping with your friends or prepare for the exam?"></a>【8】Your professor suddenly cancels the class for today. Would you prefer to go shopping with your friends or prepare for the exam?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> prepare for the exam.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> the daytime is the prime time in one day which my mind is sharp and can better concentrate on difficult tasks, and if my professor cancels the class, them I will have an entire morning or entire afternoon to study and prepare the exam because I really want to have the better grade.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> as for shopping, it will be better to shop in the night when I am tired and exhausted by the study, I can shift my mind to do something relaxed such as shopping.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to prepare for the exam if professor cancels the class.</strong></li>

<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> it is harder than before to save money.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> nowadays, we are on  a stage that there are so many place for us to spend many than before, <strong>you know,</strong> we have more electronic device to choose, and a lot of attraction to go, and none of them for free. And sometimes we spend money in a impulsive way.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> because of the currency inflation, the price of the daily merchandise are going up.</p>
<p><strong>So, it is getting harder to save money.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is because,</strong> a garden can serve more citizens in the community. <strong>You know,</strong> the elders can use this place to relax and teenagers can hang out with each other in this garden.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> the children can also use this garden to play as a playground. In the community I once lived, many parents will bring their children to the community garden to play. So, it is also a nice choice for children.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I think building a garden for the community is better.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> participating in team sports is a good way, and maybe the best way to learn team cooperation, especially for the young people.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> teamwork in sports is so important that no one can just win without an excellent cooperation with teammates. </li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> members of a football team need to cooperate to successfully perform a play, whether it be a running play or a passing play. Without all involved in the play working together to make the play happen, the other team could wind up in an ultimate victory.</li>

<li><strong>While, I do prefer to</strong> work at home.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> I can work in anytime I want. You know, I am a morning guy, so, when I get up early, like 6 o’clock or 7 o’clock, I can just get to work immediately. And in the early morning, my mind is really sharp and I can better concentrate on my tasks.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> working at home really make me feel comfortable and relaxed. <strong>You know,</strong> I can dress whatever I want, and I don’t need to worry about being interrupt by others.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to work from home.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> it is a good idea to get a job under the influence of others.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> if we take the parents idea into consideration, they will give us some precious opinion, because they are more likely to have a deep view of the strengths and weaknesses pf a job.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> the influence from friends also important because we don’t have generation gap, so their suggestions is pragmatic and suitable for me.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I would like to say that getting a job under others’ influence is a good idea.</strong></p>

Why?</p>
<p><strong>While, I would like to</strong> play inside our house.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> playing inside the house is more safe for everyone, we don’t need to worry about being stolen or robbed, and if somebody left something, it is more likely to get back. And there is little air pollution inside the house.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> I like to play inside because it is more comfortable. You know, there is no need to be well-dressed and have  to wear the jacket and tie. We could dressed informal and suit ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I prefer to play inside.</strong></p>

Why?</p>
<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> elders should not take risks and participate in adventurous.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> they have to take the safely into consideration, maybe safety is the prime consider for them. Because, compare with the young man, doing the same adventure is more risky for the elders because of their physical status are more fragile and more likely to cause physical deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> my grandpa have a slight cardiac disease, although it is not a big deal, doctor suggest him not to do the strenuous exercises because life always comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I agree that elders should not take risk to be involved in adventures.</strong></p>

<p><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make a phone call directly.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> phone calls is more directly and efficient than sending messages. If you want to communicate with or get informations from someone, you could just call them and you will get the answer and whatever you what as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> making phone call can reduce the loss of information and misunderstanding. Because, other can quickly find your misunderstanding and misstatement and correct you during the dialogue in a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I prefer to choose the phone call.</strong></p>

<li><strong>While,</strong> when I disagree with my friends or family, I tend to let them keep their own opinion.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we are different person with different background, we could not totally agree with each other on everything. So, if we try hard to convince others, we may often slide into drastic argument or even fierce fight, and sometimes end up with nothing. </li>
<li><strong>And as for me,</strong> I think distinctly express my opinion is important, but getting involved in an argument which meant to convince others are meaningless and just the waste of time.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to let them keep their own opinion.</strong></li>

To find a professional to teach them outside, or to find a student to teach them at home?</h4><p><strong>While, I think</strong> finding a students to teach elders at home is better.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> it is more convenient for elders to be taught. You know, some of the elders are not capable of leaving home because of some specific health conditions. So, it is more possible for them to be taught at home.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> it can save a lot of time for the old people, because they don’t have to spend a lot of time on the way to the class outside.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I think finding a student to teach them at home is the best choice.</strong></p>

Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> we should not discuss about the celebrities’ private activities.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> their private activities are none of my business, and their private activities are undoubtedly their privacy, and paying too much attention to their privacy will possibly cross the line and break the law.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> staying out of their personal life can help me better focus on their works. You know, when I watch a movie I really want to do deep in to the character they play not be entangled by their anecdotes.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I agree that we shouldn’t pay any attention to their private activities.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> students learn more effectively through doing other activities such as subject report.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> these kind of report or papers will give us a chance to deeply understanding the field or subject in a thorough and well-rounded way. But taking exams will limit us to study some key point which gonna be tested and ignore the others. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> completing a project will allow us to study under less pressure than the exams. And a relaxation and happiness will help us to enjoy the research which lead to high efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to do other activities than exams.</strong></li>
