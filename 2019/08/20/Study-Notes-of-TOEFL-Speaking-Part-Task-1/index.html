<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society. </li>
<li><strong>First of all</strong>, it can help people to relax. <strong>I mean</strong> people can watch some comedies or other programs that can make them laugh and forget about the troubles and stress. </li>
<li><strong>And also</strong> TV is important because it can help people to learn new skills. <strong>You know</strong> <strong>nowadays</strong> many people learn how to cook on TV,  they learn how to speak English on TV. </li>
<li><strong>So, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I would like to</strong> take courses that are from a variety of subjects areas, </li>
<li><strong>because</strong> this can help me to make more friends. <strong>You know,</strong> I can meet people from different fields and get to know them, so this can help me to build a large network. </li>
<li><strong>And besides, I like to</strong> take courses from different subject areas because many subjects fascinate me a lot. I mean sometimes I am just fascinated by math courses, and sometimes I get to learn about the history, and then I get to learn about something about arts. So this also can help me to switch my mind and to take a break.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I would like to</strong> work on class assignments in the group. </li>
<li><strong>First of all, I think</strong> this can take less time, because in a group project we can always share that tasks, and everyone just needs to complete a part of it. In this case. we can finish the whole thing much faster. </li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to</strong> do group activity,<strong>I mean</strong> group projects, because it’s a great chance for me to learn from I others. For example, I can learn how others solve a problem, and in this case I can improve myself. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore I would like</strong> to do assignments in the group.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think</strong> studying on-line <strong>is actually better.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because, personally,</strong> I  can study better on the Internet. <strong>This is because</strong> on-line lessons could be replaced for as many times as I want to. So, I can watch it over and over again until I understand all the key points.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to study on-line, because it</strong> really saves time. I mean with on-line courses, I can just stay at home. So I don’t need to spend any time traveling to the school. And in this way, I can just spend that time to do something that I like. </li>

Use details and examples to explain your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I personally think</strong> that learning art and literature <strong>is, actually more important.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because,</strong> when learning arts we get to study music, and it can help us to relax. <strong>I mean,</strong> whenever we feel tired, we can just play a beautiful piece of melody, which can help us to empty our mind. </li>
<li><strong>Beside, the reason why I think</strong> study literature <strong>is important is that</strong> through study these subject, we can actually learn some foreign culture. You know, we can understand some foreign customs, foreign festivals, while, it also can help us to make friends with foreigners.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think it is better to do</strong> different kinds of works at different points of life.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it allows me to learn a lot of skills. For example, if I do a customer service job, I can learn how to communicate with people and how to solve problems efficiently. And if I do, <strong>lets say,</strong> accountant job, I can just learn how to deal with numbers. So this can help me a lot.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> doing different jobs helps me to make friends. Because I can meet different people at different work, and we can become close with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to do</strong> different jobs in life.</li>

<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> friends are the most important influence.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> we spent more time with the friend than adults like parents. <strong>You know,</strong> we go to the same school,  which means we spend at least 8 hours a day together, and at least 5 days even 6 days in a week. <strong>So</strong>, friend have a lot of chances to influence us. <strong>you know,</strong> they can change our thoughts or even behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> we do not have generation gaps with each other. And we tend to believe that they can fully understand us and know our circumstances.  <strong>That’s why</strong> we are more likely to accept their idea and suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>As a result, we receive more influence from friends.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> all children should be required to learn a second language in school.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> being able to speak a second language is such a important skill. <strong>Because,</strong> nowadays, it is so common to make business with foreigners. <strong>So by being</strong> able to speak a second language, you know, those students are able to find better jobs in the futures, and they are able to work in the foreign company and make more money.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> learning a second language could be really fun. <strong>Because</strong> one can learn about the foreign culture, such as foreign food and foreign festivals such as Halloween and so one.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> the parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> sometimes the TV could be addictive. You know, some kids just can not stop watching TV, so, by limiting the programs children can watch, the parents can make sure their kids have enough time to study, or enough time to exercise, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, the parents should control the programs that their kids watch because,</strong> there are some programs that are not appropriate for the teenagers to watch, such as their a lot of screens that contain blood or violence which could really bring bad influences.</li>

<li><strong>because,</strong> after learning this skill, people can just better relax themselves. <strong>I mean,</strong> when they feel tired or stressed, the can play the musical instruments; They can play a beautiful melody which take their mind away from their troubles. </li>
<li><strong>Besides</strong>, I think this is an important skill because it can easily impress others. On a party or a social gethering, a person who can play the piano can always win people’s respect.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> students should bring cell phones into the class.</li>
<li><strong>I mean,</strong> cell phones can help them to learn better. <strong>First of all,</strong> they can use cell phones to do research. <strong>For example,</strong> if I meet a term that I don’t understand or do not clearly know the definition. I can use the cell phones to look them up online, so I this can help me to better understand the professor’s lecture.</li>
<li><strong>Besides</strong>, students can use their cell phones to record the lecture. I mean, they can record the whole thing, so they can listen to it again and again after class to make sure they understand everthing.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, students should bring cell phones into the class.</strong></li>

Maybe their kids focus on the major that they like, but the parents will think about something different, such as their career, their jobs or their opportunities, even including their salaries, staff like that. That why, if their parents help them to choose the university, I think they may end up arguing. They may argue about what, you know, what to study, or where to go.</li>
