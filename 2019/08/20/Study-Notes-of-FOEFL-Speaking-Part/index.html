Others believe it has had a negative influence on society.</h4><p>Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society. </li>
<li><strong>First of all</strong>, it can help people to relax. <strong>I mean</strong> people can watch some comedies or other programs that can make them laugh and forget about the troubles and stress. </li>
<li><strong>And also</strong> TV is important because it can help people to learn new skills. <strong>You know</strong> <strong>nowadays</strong> many people learn how to cook on TV,  they learn how to speak English on TV. </li>
<li><strong>So, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society.</li>

Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area.</h4><p>Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I would like to</strong> take courses that are from a variety of subjects areas, </li>
<li><strong>because</strong> this can help me to make more friends. <strong>You know,</strong> I can meet people from different fields and get to know them, so this can help me to build a large network. </li>
<li><strong>And besides, I like to</strong> take courses from different subject areas because many subjects fascinate me a lot. I mean sometimes I am just fascinated by math courses, and sometimes I get to learn about the history, and then I get to learn about something about arts. So this also can help me to switch my mind and to take a break.</li>

Others believe it is better to work in a group.</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Explain why. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I would like to</strong> work on class assignments in the group. </li>
<li><strong>First of all, I think</strong> this can take less time, because in a group project we can always share that tasks, and everyone just needs to complete a part of it. In this case. we can finish the whole thing much faster. </li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to</strong> do group activity,<strong>I mean</strong> group projects, because it’s a great chance for me to learn from I others. For example, I can learn how others solve a problem, and in this case I can improve myself. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore I would like</strong> to do assignments in the group.</li>

However, some people still prefer learning in traditional classrooms.</h4><p>Which do you think is better? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think</strong> studying on-line <strong>is actually better.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because, personally,</strong> I  can study better on the Internet. <strong>This is because</strong> on-line lessons could be replaced for as many times as I want to. So, I can watch it over and over again until I understand all the key points.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to study on-line, because it</strong> really saves time. I mean with on-line courses, I can just stay at home. So I don’t need to spend any time traveling to the school. And in this way, I can just spend that time to do something that I like. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to</strong> study on-line.</li>

Use details and examples to explain your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I personally think</strong> that learning art and literature <strong>is, actually more important.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because,</strong> when learning arts we get to study music, and it can help us to relax. <strong>I mean,</strong> whenever we feel tired, we can just play a beautiful piece of melody, which can help us to empty our mind. </li>
<li><strong>Beside, the reason why I think</strong> study literature <strong>is important is that</strong> through study these subject, we can actually learn some foreign culture. You know, we can understand some foreign customs, foreign festivals, while, it also can help us to make friends with foreigners.</li>

Other people do different kinds of work at different points in their lives.</h4><p>Which do you think is better? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think it is better to do</strong> different kinds of works at different points of life.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it allows me to learn a lot of skills. For example, if I do a customer service job, I can learn how to communicate with people and how to solve problems efficiently. And if I do, <strong>lets say,</strong> accountant job, I can just learn how to deal with numbers. So this can help me a lot.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> doing different jobs helps me to make friends. Because I can meet different people at different work, and we can become close with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to do</strong> different jobs in life.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, a student thinks that the university shouldn’t require this sculpture,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>umm, this is because, you know,</strong> the university is in no financial position of doing so, </li>
<li><strong>and also,</strong> the sculpture is actually quite large, so it will take up all the green space. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the women didn’t like this idea,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>this is because, umm, actually,</strong> the university didn’t pay for the sculpture , there is a donor donating this to the university. </li>
<li><strong>also</strong> she know why this students didn’t like this sculpture<strong>, this is because, you know,</strong> he can’t play soccer in that green area anymore, and for him, he doesn’t want to move. </li>
</ul>

<li><strong><em>While, the university plans to eliminate the bus service.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>uum, this is because</strong> only few students ride it and also it is kind of expensive to operate it.</li>
<li><strong>uum, on top of that,</strong> the money saved by eliminate the bus could be used to expand the parking lots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the man did not like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>He thinks that</strong> the route of the bus is out of date, and this is why students didn’t take the bus. <strong>you know,</strong> the bus only go through the expensive neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>and the students also didn’t like the idea of</strong> expanding the parking spaces, because this will encourage more students to drive, which will add more noise and you know students will end up needing more parking spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Therefore, he doesn’t like the idea.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TASK-3"><a href="#TASK-3" class="headerlink" title="TASK 3"></a>TASK 3</h2><h4 id="【TPO-1】Group-Think"><a href="#【TPO-1】Group-Think" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 1】Group Think"></a>【TPO 1】Group Think</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While the reading passage talks about the group think,</em></strong> <ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> the individual members try to conform their opinion to what they believe to be group consensus, even though the result could be negative. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example, the professor suggest that a design makeover for the company’s product,</em></strong> <ul>
<li>at first, more than half of people support his idea, but one senior manager did not like his idea because he said the focus should be on the technology not on the design, suddenly, people start to change their attitude, because they don’t want to disagree with the manager. Eventually, most people decided to stay with the current design. Unfortunately, the competitor at that year, came out a new design that attracted some of  their customers. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Therefore, this is a good example for group think.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="【TPO-2】"><a href="#【TPO-2】" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 2】"></a>【TPO 2】</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about audience effect.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>It means that</strong> individual at work is effected by the knowledge that they are being  visible to others.</li>
<li><strong>uum, for example,</strong> there are two groups of students who are putting on their shoes, the first group are told that they were observed, and the second group, they didn’t know they are observed. And for the results, the group one tight their shoes faster. </li>
<li><strong>While another example is about</strong> how to type, if we know there are some people are observing us, we tend to type faster, at the same time, interestingly, we may also to make more mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Therefore, these are two examples to explain the idea of audience effect.</em></strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, in this lecture, the professor talks about that</em></strong> the babies are actually have the ability of mathematics. <ul>
<li><strong>To be more specific,</strong> he believe that the baby can add. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example the professor</em></strong> introduce a experiment.<ul>
<li>A baby was shown a doll, and then the researchers are lower the screen to hide the doll. Next the researcher took another doll and act obviously behind the screen to make sure the baby saw that, but after this the researchers secretly took away one doll and raise up the screen. And baby was surprised by just seen one doll behind the screen which should be two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>This is why</em></strong> professor believe that the baby’s can add.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="【TPO-2】-1"><a href="#【TPO-2】-1" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 2】"></a>【TPO 2】</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the professor talks about two definitions of money.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> a narrow one to definite money. Money could be considered as coins or bills.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the person 5 dollars to taxis driver in order to purchase a ride, and the the taxis driver may give the farmer 5 dollars to purchase the vegetables. So, this is the narrow definition of money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, there is</strong> a broad definition of money, which is that the good or services are use to exchange for other goods or services. <ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the taxis driver may use a drive to exchange for the vegetables from a farmer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Therefore, there are two definitions of money.</em></strong></li>
