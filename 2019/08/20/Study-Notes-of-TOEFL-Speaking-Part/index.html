<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society. </li>
<li><strong>First of all</strong>, it can help people to relax. <strong>I mean</strong> people can watch some comedies or other programs that can make them laugh and forget about the troubles and stress. </li>
<li><strong>And also</strong> TV is important because it can help people to learn new skills. <strong>You know</strong> <strong>nowadays</strong> many people learn how to cook on TV,  they learn how to speak English on TV. </li>
<li><strong>So, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society.</li>

Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area.</h4><p>Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I would like to</strong> take courses that are from a variety of subjects areas, </li>
<li><strong>because</strong> this can help me to make more friends. <strong>You know,</strong> I can meet people from different fields and get to know them, so this can help me to build a large network. </li>
<li><strong>And besides, I like to</strong> take courses from different subject areas because many subjects fascinate me a lot. I mean sometimes I am just fascinated by math courses, and sometimes I get to learn about the history, and then I get to learn about something about arts. So this also can help me to switch my mind and to take a break.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I would like to</strong> work on class assignments in the group. </li>
<li><strong>First of all, I think</strong> this can take less time, because in a group project we can always share that tasks, and everyone just needs to complete a part of it. In this case. we can finish the whole thing much faster. </li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to</strong> do group activity,<strong>I mean</strong> group projects, because it’s a great chance for me to learn from I others. For example, I can learn how others solve a problem, and in this case I can improve myself. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore I would like</strong> to do assignments in the group.</li>

However, some people still prefer learning in traditional classrooms.</h4><p>Which do you think is better? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think</strong> studying on-line <strong>is actually better.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because, personally,</strong> I  can study better on the Internet. <strong>This is because</strong> on-line lessons could be replaced for as many times as I want to. So, I can watch it over and over again until I understand all the key points.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to study on-line, because it</strong> really saves time. I mean with on-line courses, I can just stay at home. So I don’t need to spend any time traveling to the school. And in this way, I can just spend that time to do something that I like. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to</strong> study on-line.</li>

Use details and examples to explain your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I personally think</strong> that learning art and literature <strong>is, actually more important.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because,</strong> when learning arts we get to study music, and it can help us to relax. <strong>I mean,</strong> whenever we feel tired, we can just play a beautiful piece of melody, which can help us to empty our mind. </li>
<li><strong>Beside, the reason why I think</strong> study literature <strong>is important is that</strong> through study these subject, we can actually learn some foreign culture. You know, we can understand some foreign customs, foreign festivals, while, it also can help us to make friends with foreigners.</li>

Other people do different kinds of work at different points in their lives.</h4><p>Which do you think is better? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think it is better to do</strong> different kinds of works at different points of life.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it allows me to learn a lot of skills. For example, if I do a customer service job, I can learn how to communicate with people and how to solve problems efficiently. And if I do, <strong>lets say,</strong> accountant job, I can just learn how to deal with numbers. So this can help me a lot.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> doing different jobs helps me to make friends. Because I can meet different people at different work, and we can become close with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to do</strong> different jobs in life.</li>

Then explain your reasons, using specific details in your explanation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> learning through online courses is more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> when taking those online courses I could study whenever I feel best. <strong>You know,</strong> I am a morning person, so, I can just take the online courses in the early morning, like 6 o’clock or 7 o’clock. <strong>And by doing so,</strong> I will really sharp and can concentrate better. So this can help me to understand all the key points much better.</li>
<li><strong>And,</strong> online courses could be repeated, so I can watch it again and again until I remember all the detail and key points.</li>

Others believe that friends are the most important influence. Which do you agree with?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> friends are the most important influence.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> we spent more time with the friend than adults like parents. <strong>You know,</strong> we go to the same school,  which means we spend at least 8 hours a day together, and at least 5 days even 6 days in a week. <strong>So</strong>, friend have a lot of chances to influence us. <strong>you know,</strong> they can change our thoughts or even behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> we do not have generation gaps with each other. And we tend to believe that they can fully understand us and know our circumstances.  <strong>That’s why</strong> we are more likely to accept their idea and suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>As a result, we receive more influence from friends.</strong></li>

Use details and examples to explain your answer. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> all children should be required to learn a second language in school.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> being able to speak a second language is such a important skill. <strong>Because,</strong> nowadays, it is so common to make business with foreigners. <strong>So by being</strong> able to speak a second language, you know, those students are able to find better jobs in the futures, and they are able to work in the foreign company and make more money.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> learning a second language could be really fun. <strong>Because</strong> one can learn about the foreign culture, such as foreign food and foreign festivals such as Halloween and so one.</li>
<li><strong>So, students should learn a second language at school.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> the parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> sometimes the TV could be addictive. You know, some kids just can not stop watching TV, so, by limiting the programs children can watch, the parents can make sure their kids have enough time to study, or enough time to exercise, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, the parents should control the programs that their kids watch because,</strong> there are some programs that are not appropriate for the teenagers to watch, such as their a lot of screens that contain blood or violence which could really bring bad influences.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> it is essential for a person to learn how to play a musical instrument, </li>
<li><strong>because,</strong> after learning this skill, people can just better relax themselves. <strong>I mean,</strong> when they feel tired or stressed, the can play the musical instruments; They can play a beautiful melody which take their mind away from their troubles. </li>
<li><strong>Besides</strong>, I think this is an important skill because it can easily impress others. On a party or a social gethering, a person who can play the piano can always win people’s respect.</li>
<li><strong>So, it’s important for people to learn how to play the musical instruments.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> the best way to learn is just by making mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong> the mistakes can leaves us a deep impression, which can help us to remember the lesson learnt from it for quite a long time. <strong>You know,</strong> when I was a young kid, I used to be very selfish, and I as really rude to my friend. <strong>Then</strong> I realized that I disappointed them a lot and finally lose a lot of friends. So even nowadays, I can still remember the lesson learnt from it. I always remind myself to be considerate, to be nice to others. </li>

<li><strong>Besides</strong>, students can use their cell phones to record the lecture. I mean, they can record the whole thing, so they can listen to it again and again after class to make sure they understand everthing.</li>

<li>Because, parents usually don’t know what are their children really want. You know, they and their kids always are aiming to different things. Maybe their kids focus on the major that they like, but the parents will think about something different, such as their career, their jobs or their opportunities, even including their salaries, staff like that. That why, if their parents help them to choose the university, I think they may end up arguing. They may argue about what, you know, what to study, or where to go.</li>

So, if there are a lot of advertisements for French fries, or hamburgers, they are more likely to be influenced, you know, their might eat this kind of food everyday complement with coca cola.

<li><strong><em>For example, the professor suggest that a design makeover for the company’s product,</em></strong><ul>
<li>at first, more than half of people support his idea, but one senior manager did not like his idea because he said the focus should be on the technology not on the design, suddenly, people start to change their attitude, because they don’t want to disagree with the manager. Eventually, most people decided to stay with the current design. Unfortunately, the competitor at that year, came out a new design that attracted some of their customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example for group think.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about audience effect.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>It means that</strong> individual at work is effected by the knowledge that they are being visible to others.</li>
<li><strong>uum, for example,</strong> there are two groups of students who are putting on their shoes, the first group are told that they were observed, and the second group, they didn’t know they are observed. And for the results, the group one tight their shoes faster.</li>
<li><strong>While another example is about</strong> how to type, if we know there are some people are observing us, we tend to type faster, at the same time, interestingly, we may also to make more mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are two examples to explain the idea of audience effect.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about cognitive dissonant.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> discomfort by conflict between the one’s believes and one’s action.</li>
<li><strong>for example,</strong> the professor was addicted to the video game in high school, so he doesn’t perform well in the chemistry. Then he just had this conflict, because he thought he has to do well in all subjects if he want to succeed in futures. In order to solve this conflict, the professor changed his perspective, since he didn’t want to be a chemist, he realize that chemistry didn’t matter, he just have to do well in sociology because he want to be a sociologist. So, he reinterpret the situation to solve the conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is the good example to explain the cognitive dissonant.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li><strong><em>While, in this lecture, the professor talks about that</em></strong> the babies are actually have the ability of mathematics.<ul>
<li><strong>To be more specific,</strong> he believe that the baby can add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example the professor</em></strong> introduce a experiment.<ul>
<li>A baby was shown a doll, and then the researchers are lower the screen to hide the doll. Next the researcher took another doll and act obviously behind the screen to make sure the baby saw that, but after this the researchers secretly took away one doll and raise up the screen. And baby was surprised by just seen one doll behind the screen which should be two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>This is why</strong> professor believe that the baby’s can add.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two definitions of money.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> a narrow one to definite money. Money could be considered as coins or bills.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the person 5 dollars to taxis driver in order to purchase a ride, and the the taxis driver may give the farmer 5 dollars to purchase the vegetables. So, this is the narrow definition of money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, there is</strong> a broad definition of money, which is that the good or services are use to exchange for other goods or services.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the taxis driver may use a drive to exchange for the vegetables from a farmer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, there are two definitions of money.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="【TPO-3】Two-strategy-of-advertising"><a href="#【TPO-3】Two-strategy-of-advertising" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 3】Two strategy of advertising"></a>【TPO 3】Two strategy of advertising</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two strategies of advertising.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong>  repetition.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in a car commercial prefer to the roomy cars, this car just keep picking up people, and every time when someone gets on, a person said plenty room for friends, or plenty room for family. So, by being repeating that, the people will be convinced that the car is spacious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another strategy is</strong> to use celebrities.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> a celebrities in a car said that I like my car being fast. Then, in this case, the people will believe that the car is impressive for its speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are strategies for advertising.</strong></li>
