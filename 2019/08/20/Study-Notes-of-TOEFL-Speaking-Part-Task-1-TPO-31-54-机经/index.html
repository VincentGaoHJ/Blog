Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I don’t think</strong> parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a career.</li>
<li><strong>First of all, I don’t think</strong> parents really understand their kids, their don’t know what their kids really like, or what their kids what. So if their really get involved, they wouldn’t do any good.</li>
<li><strong>Instead,</strong> they may end up arguing with their kids, <strong>you know,</strong> since they have different ideas, or different opinions. And this kind of arguing my take up long time.</li>
<li><strong>So, I believe, parents, if they get involved, it will be just the waste of time.</strong></li>

Other students prefer to take easier classes in which they know they will get a good grade.</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honestly, I rather</strong> take the easier classes.</li>
<li><strong>Because</strong>, when taking this kind of easier classes, I just don’t need to spend all day long studying. <strong>You know</strong>, I can only sepend a few hours everyday and I can just finish all my assignments. <strong>In this cases,</strong> I will have the time to do the things that I like. Such as hanging out with parents or friends, or just do a part time job to make some money.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> I like this easier classes because I want to get a better grade. <strong>You know,</strong> that will make me feel good and feel more confident if I do have a better grade. <strong>And not to mention</strong>, It will help me to find better job in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to take easier classes.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> it was much easier to eat healthy food in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> the environment is better, <strong>you know</strong>, there was no pollution, so the water was clean, the air was clear. So the food we ate was generally much healthier.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> in the past, people have more time to cook <em>at home</em>. So, the meal they had was healthy because they could make the dinner <em>complement with vegetables</em>. But nowadays, since people are busy, they just rely heavily on fast food which is not healthy at all.</li>
<li><strong>So, that why I believe it’s much easier to eat healthy food in the past.</strong></li>

Use details and examples to explain your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> the private car should not be allowed in the city centers of larges cities.</li>
<li><strong>Because, nowadays,</strong> there are too many cars in the downtown area. You know, the traffic condition is really bad in the rush hours and no one can move in the road. You know it took people hours to get to the destination. </li>
<li><strong>But,</strong> if the private car are not allowed, and people work in the city center could use the public transit, so, without a lot of private cars, the bus can move freely and easily, so it’s a win-win strategy because everyone can arrive their destination much faster.</li>

Use examples and details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> the academic reputation is the most important factor for students to choose a university.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> if one can choose a university with good academic reputation, <strong>that means</strong>, he can learn quite a lot in there, this is because, this university often have a lot of famous professors, and also have really practical curriculum. </li>
<li>So by going to or choosing such a university, this can just make sure students can learn everything that they need to know. And guarantee them a bright future.</li>
<li><strong>So, that’s why I believe that academic reputation is actually the most important factor to consider.</strong></li>

Other people buy fresh food and prepare meals themselves.</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Explain why, using details and examples in your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> buy fresh food and prepare my own meals.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> it’s just much cheaper, you know, the vegetables and raw meat cost only half as much as the already prepared meals. So by doing this, I can save a fortune every month.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> I like to do so, because, I just enjoy cooking, you know, I would like to experiment different recipes, complement various foods different vegetables. So, in this case, by purchasing the fresh food and preparing my own meals at home, it just gives me the joy that I am looking for.</li>

Use specific examples and details to support opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> the students will learn more if the teachers is kind and friendly.</li>
<li><strong>Because</strong>, in this case, students will feel relax, you know they can feel they are ease, so during the class, they are more likely to focus on the content in the lesson, and I am sure, they can learn better.</li>
<li><strong>And besides</strong>, when teacher is kind and friendly, students will become friends with them, we always listen to our friend right. <strong>So, in this cases,</strong> their students are more likely to accept the teachers ideas, opinions, even the criticisms.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I believe that the students will learn more if the teacher is kind and friendly.</strong></li>

Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> it is more enjoyable to read fiction such as novels and stories.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> the fictions will often have really interesting characters. For example, in some fictions, the antagonist maybe a monster and the protagonist maybe a hero. This kind of fictions or stories fascinate me a lot. So, you know it just so much more exciting than reading some nonfictions.</li>
<li><strong>And besides, reading some fictions is</strong> more enjoyable, because, fictions could take place in the magic world where everyone has magic power, so, it’s just more fun than reading a dull nonfiction such as documentary or biography.</li>

<li><strong>Simply because that</strong> I am good at it. You know, I would like to give presentations. By giving a speech, I am sure that I can done this work perfectly. And I am sure that I can get a better grade.</li>
<li><strong>And besides, as for me,</strong> a speech just take less time to prepare, <strong>you know</strong>, if I need to write a long report, I have to do research for weeks, but if I need to give a speech, <strong>you know,</strong> I only need to practice or rehearse a couple of times. <strong>So, in this case,</strong> it just take less time for me to prepare.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I believe that</strong> one day the paper material will be replaced by the electronic versions.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> e-books are convenient. <strong>You know,</strong> nowadays, many people enjoy reading on their cell phones, and that is much easier to carry their cell phone around than carry heavy paper books.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> e-books are cheaper, because they usually cost only half as much as the paper materials. <strong>So</strong>, reading electronic versions, people can save a lot of money.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I believe the electronic books will be more popular in the future.</strong></li>

Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think it would be better to</strong> attend college full-time.</li>
<li><strong>Because</strong>, students can learn more in this case. They can spend all their time taking different courses, or learning different subject. <strong>So</strong>, I’m sure they will become knowledgeable, and they can find job easily in the future.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> attending college full-time can help them to make more friends. You know, they can spend a lot of time together with their classmates. <strong>So</strong>, this can help them to  get to know each other. <em>So, I’m sure this can have a lot of fun.</em></li>
<li><strong>Therefore, it’s better to attend college full-time.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> primary schools should teach children how to type.</li>
<li><strong>Because</strong>, typing is much faster than writing by hands. <strong>I think</strong> people can do that at least two times faster. <strong>So in this case, you know,</strong> students can be more efficient when they type.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> I think typing is more convenient. <strong>Because, nowadays,</strong> when people type a paper on the computer, they can use the spell check to correct their mistakes. <strong>So,</strong> this can make sure they can write a good article.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, school should only teach the students how to type.</strong></li>
