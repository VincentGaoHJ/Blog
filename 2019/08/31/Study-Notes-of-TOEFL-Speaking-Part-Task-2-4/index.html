<li><strong><em>While, a student thinks that the university shouldn’t require this sculpture,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>umm, this is because, you know,</strong> the university is in no financial position of doing so,</li>
<li><strong>and also,</strong> the sculpture is actually quite large, so it will take up all the green space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the women didn’t like this idea,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>this is because, umm, actually,</strong> the university didn’t pay for the sculpture , there is a donor donating this to the university.</li>
<li><strong>also</strong> she know why this students didn’t like this sculpture<strong>, this is because, you know,</strong> he can’t play soccer in that green area anymore, and for him, he doesn’t want to move.</li>

<li><strong>uum, on top of that,</strong> the money saved by eliminate the bus could be used to expand the parking lots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the man did not like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>He thinks that</strong> the route of the bus is out of date, and this is why students didn’t take the bus. <strong>you know,</strong> the bus only go through the expensive neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>and the students also didn’t like the idea of</strong> expanding the parking spaces, because this will encourage more students to drive, which will add more noise and you know students will end up needing more parking spaces.</li>

<li><strong>For example,</strong> in the cold morning, students will love to have some hot cereal rather than cold yogurt.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> the women doesn’t think this can help them to save money, because if school doesn’t offer hot breakfast, students have to go to off-campus places to get them.</li>

<li><strong>This is because</strong> this action can strengthen the relationship between school and town.</li>
<li><strong>and also,</strong> it can help students to discover the love of doing the service that can inspire them.</li>

</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the men doesn’t like this idea.</em></strong><ul>

</li>
<li><strong><em>You know, the man really likes the idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> he says that, not everyone like the same thing, like he didn’t like sleeping in a tent, so that is why he didn’t go to his orientation program.</li>

<li><strong><em>While the reading passage talks about the group think,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> the individual members try to conform their opinion to what they believe to be group consensus, even though the result could be negative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example, the professor suggest that a design makeover for the company’s product,</em></strong><ul>
<li>at first, more than half of people support his idea, but one senior manager did not like his idea because he said the focus should be on the technology not on the design, suddenly, people start to change their attitude, because they don’t want to disagree with the manager.

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about audience effect.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>It means that</strong> individual at work is effected by the knowledge that they are being visible to others.</li>
<li><strong>uum, for example,</strong> there are two groups of students who are putting on their shoes, the first group are told that they were observed, and the second group, they didn’t know they are observed. And for the results, the group one tight their shoes faster.</li>
<li><strong>While another example is about</strong> how to type, if we know there are some people are observing us, we tend to type faster, at the same time, interestingly, we may also to make more mistakes.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about cognitive dissonant.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> discomfort by conflict between the one’s believes and one’s action.</li>
<li><strong>for example,</strong> the professor was addicted to the video game in high school, so he doesn’t perform well in the chemistry. Then he just had this conflict, because he thought he has to do well in all subjects if he want to succeed in futures. In order to solve this conflict, the professor changed his perspective, since he didn’t want to be a chemist, he realize that chemistry didn’t matter, he just have to do well in sociology because he want to be a sociologist. So, he reinterpret the situation to solve the conflict.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about system thinking.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> company will solve the problem in a long-term, considering the interaction of different parts contributing to the problem.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor used to work in a company where workers were absent a lot. So, the company hire a consultant to solve the problem. So, they did a lot of research, such as interview a lot of employees, as well as research on the eating facilities and health service. Then they found that, worker missed their work because of the health problem, you know, they are lack of exercises, so the consultant suggested that company could build a gym and offer more nutritious menu at cafeteria. And about a year late, attendance were no longer a problem.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about chaining behavior</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know,</strong> it is a technique used by parents to teach kinds how to do a complex behavior.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor taught her daughter how to wash hand. First, he divided this behavior into five small steps, turning on the water, wetting hands, putting on soap, washing hands and turning off water, so first, he taught her daughter step one, and he taught her daughter step two when she can do step one herself and ask her to do both step one and step two.

<li><strong><em>While, the professor talks about procedural memories.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>Which is means</strong> the memories of the process of performing a task that become automatic with practice.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor took a guitar lesson when he was young. During the class, his teacher show him how to hold the guitar, where to play his finger on the string. When he back home, he would play for hours everyday. So, the professor could pick up the guitar and play a son without thinking. But then, he stop playing for years. But on day, when he found his old guitar, he realized that he still knew how to play every song.</li>

<li><strong>For example,</strong> There is kind of birds that eats shell fish. So it dive into the water to catch the shell fish and carry it into the air so as to drop it to let it open. And this birds select the biggest birds available because this action can make sure they get the biggest possible meal. And besides, the birds also carry the fish to a certain height and then drop it, because if it goes any lower, it may have to drop it again and any higher altitude seem unnecessary to them and just the waste of energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, the bird is a good example to explain the optimal foraging.</strong></li>

<h4 id="【TPO-47】Reactance"><a href="#【TPO-47】Reactance" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 47】Reactance"></a>【TPO 47】Reactance</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about reactance.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that</strong> individual desire to reestablish the freedom and to control the situation.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> like a kids, he likes to play at a playground, but his parent won’t want him to play in there anymore. But still, the kids will snick to play despite the rules.</li>
<li><strong>And a second example is about</strong> banning a certain kind of soap. People are really upset about this decision because they though they should be able to buy whatever they want. So, before the actual ban, a lot of people went to store and bought a lot of soap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>So, these are two examples to explain the reactance.</strong></li>

<h4 id="【TPO-46】Warning-Correlation"><a href="#【TPO-46】Warning-Correlation" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 46】Warning Correlation"></a>【TPO 46】Warning Correlation</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about warning correlation.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that</strong> animals, they have distinct coloring that signal predators of the defense mechanism they have.</li>
<li><strong>For example, the skunk. </strong>They have a black body, they also have a white stripe running from their head to the tail. And skunk, they can produce horrible smell liquid to protect themselves. </li>
<li><strong>So for example,</strong> when a wolf approaches to a skunk, it will just spread the liquid to the wolf. And the wolf would just back off because of that terrible smelling liquid. So, in the future, if the wolf see a white stripe again, it will force the wolf to recall the terrible smell and it would stay far away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example to illustrate warning correlation.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about method of loci.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means</strong> a technique to remember several pieces of information in a particular order.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> someone has to remember the sequence of planet in the order of their distance from the sun.</li>
<li><strong>So this person can</strong> imagine the walk from dormitory to the students center. So, the first land mark is the door and the second land mark is the beautiful tree, and a statue.</li>
<li><strong>So to</strong> remember the name of planets, this person can assign one planet to each land mark. Like mercury with the door and Venus with the tree and so on. </li>
<li><strong>So, in the test,</strong> when he needs to recall this information, he can just imagine the walk from the dorm to the student center.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about scope creep.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that,</strong> as the project progresses, clients may ask for more  than the business originally expected to provide.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor has a construction company.</li>
<li>The company was hired to build a wooden fence for a lady. They made a verbal agreement and they didn’t put anything in writing. Later, when the job was almost done, the lady said she wanted the fence to be painted white. But the professor’s friends thought he was hired to build the fence, not to paint the fence in addition. But eventually, he just agreed to paint but he was not happy about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example to illustrate scope creep.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, there are two types of factors that can cause population changes.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> biotic factors, which are living factors that can influence the size of population.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> mice and awl, since awls eat mice. So, the number of mice depend on the number of awl. And one year, awls are more than usual, so the number of mice drops.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>And the other fact is called</strong> abiotic factor, which are the non-living things in the environment.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> rabbits. They often start to have their young in the end of the winter. But one year, the winter season are really short, so the rabbits can start to reproduce much earlier. As a result, the number of rabbits increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Therefore, these are the two factors that can cause population changes.</em></strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, in this lecture, the professor talks about that</em></strong> the babies are actually have the ability of mathematics.<ul>
<li><strong>To be more specific,</strong> he believe that the baby can add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example the professor</em></strong> introduce a experiment.<ul>
<li>A baby was shown a doll, and then the researchers are lower the screen to hide the doll. Next the researcher took another doll and act obviously behind the screen to make sure the baby saw that, but after this the researchers secretly took away one doll and raise up the screen. And baby was surprised by just seen one doll behind the screen which should be two.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two definitions of money.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> a narrow one to definite money. Money could be considered as coins or bills.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the person 5 dollars to taxis driver in order to purchase a ride, and the the taxis driver may give the farmer 5 dollars to purchase the vegetables. So, this is the narrow definition of money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, there is</strong> a broad definition of money, which is that the good or services are use to exchange for other goods or services.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the taxis driver may use a drive to exchange for the vegetables from a farmer.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two strategies of advertising.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong>  repetition.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in a car commercial prefer to the roomy cars, this car just keep picking up people, and every time when someone gets on, a person said plenty room for friends, or plenty room for family. So, by being repeating that, the people will be convinced that the car is spacious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another strategy is</strong> to use celebrities.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> a celebrities in a car said that I like my car being fast. Then, in this case, the people will believe that the car is impressive for its speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are strategies for advertising.</strong></li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two factors about animal’s biological cycle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> the internal clock.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the flying squeals, they flying during the night and sleep during the night. But if they are not exposed to the sunlight, they can still maintain the activity pattern. This is because their internal clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another factors is</strong> external cue.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> after this constant darkness, the flying squeals are exposed to daylight. At first, their schedule can not match up, they will wake up at the mid night. But after a while, the external cue and help them to adjust the internal clock until they go back to normal activity cycle.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two ways to prevent food spoilage and why they are effective.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first way is to</strong> control the temperature<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> the fresh fish, if it is left out under the sunlight, it would spoiled in hours, but if we freeze it, it could be kept for month. </li>
<li><strong>It is because</strong> the low temperature can slow down the bacteria growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another way is to</strong> control the moisture.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> the regular milk, it spoils really quickly, but milk in powder form can last for years. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> without moisture and water condition, the bacteria can not grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>So, these are two ways to prevent food from spoilage and why they are effective.</strong></li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two disadvantages of living in groups.</li>
<li><strong>The  first one is that,</strong> they are more visible to predators.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> sardines, they often swim in groups, so, the whales, well their predators, probably wouldn’t notice one sardine. But, whale could easily a group of sardines and eat them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another</strong> disadvantage has to do with caring for the young.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> millions of bats lives in a cave, so a mother bat returns from finding food, she might feed the baby of another mother bat. In this case, her own baby couldn’t get fed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are</strong> two disadvantages of living in group for animals.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two ways that advertising may negatively affect the environments.</li>
<li><strong>While, the first case is that,</strong> it could be wasting of natural resources.<ul>
<li>Like once, the advertising kitchen renovation service, it is all waste of papers and trees, because the whole book is irrelevant to the professor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, you know,</strong> sometimes the advertising will negatively affect the natural beauty.<ul>
<li>For example, you can see some big ads on the side of the road when passing through a mountain. In this case, people can not just appreciate the beauty of the environment because the big ads get in the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>So, these are two ways that</strong> advertising can negatively affect the environment.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two benefits of animal domestication for early humans.</li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> providing human with consistent meat.<ul>
<li>Like goats were domesticated, and they are able to move from place to place. So, when early human need meat. They can provide consistent and reliable meats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The another one is</strong> that they can supply a variety of foods other than meat.<ul>
<li>Like domesticated goats could produce milk, so early human can collect it and drink it. They can also process the milk into cheese or yogurt, which could be stored.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two</strong> explanation why we may remember some things better than others.</li>
<li><strong>The first case is</strong> we remember better if we have previous knowledge.<ul>
<li><strong>Let’s say</strong> someone goes to a classic concert, you know, if the person knows the classic music a lot, it is much easier for one to recall the details of the concert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another thing is that</strong> we remember better if there is something special.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in a class with more than one hundred students. People can remember someone who is tall or someone who is intelligent. Because this features make them easy to be remembered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are two explanations for</strong> why we remember something better. </li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> how producing electricity benefit the fish.</li>
<li><strong>The first benefit is that</strong> this can help the fish to capture the prey.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the electric eel, it can produce a strong electric current. So, when it finds the food, it would just shock the fish and make sure it can get the food.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another benefit is that</strong> producing electricity can help the fish to navigate their environment.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> the knife fish, it creates electrical field around it. So, when it swim around a rock, it would sense the interference, so it can swim around the rock and avoid  crashing into it.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two benefits of forest fires for animals.</li>
<li><strong>The first one is that</strong> forest fires could make it easier for predator to find food.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> wild turkeys, they usually just wait at the edge of forest fire. They just wait for insects escaping from it. So, in this case, they can easily gather a lot of foods. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another benefits is that</strong> forest fires can make the forest a good place for animal developments.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> like some trees, their are poisonous for some beetles.  But after the fire, the trees are died, so the beetles can easily and safely lay eggs, and young beetles can use the tree as nourishment.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor mainly talks about two different ways</strong> in which animals provide themselves with food.</li>
<li><strong>The first one</strong> is that animals may cultivate plants.<ul>
<li><strong>Like danzo fish,</strong> they likes to eat  a kind of sea weed. So, basically, they will provide protection to sea weeds. If they see some plants block the sunlight from the sea weeds, they would just bite them off. In this case, the sea weeds could grow and danzo fish can have a lot to eat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another one is that</strong> animals may take care of other animals.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> black ants, they take care of aphids, because aphids can provide sweet liquids that they eat. So, ants will guard them, and even raise their young. So, in this case, ant could make aphids as a reliable resources of foods. </li>
