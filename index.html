It can help you prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance Mode:</strong> <strong>users can’t overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings</strong> unless they have special permissions.</li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance Mode: a protected object version can’t be overwritten or deleted by any user</strong>, including the root user in your aws account. Compliance mode ensures an object version can’t be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the <strong>retention period.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Retention Period &amp; Legal Holds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retention period: Protects an object version for a fixed amount of time.</strong><ul>
<li>After the retention period expires, the object version can be overwritten or deleted unless you also placed a legal hold on the object version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legal Holds: S3 Object Lock also enables you to place a legal hold on an object version.</strong> <ul>
<li>Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. </li>
<li>However, a legal hold doesn’t have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed. </li>
<li>Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the <code>S3:PutObjectLegalHold</code> permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.</p>
<h2 id="S3-Performance"><a href="#S3-Performance" class="headerlink" title="S3 Performance"></a>S3 Performance</h2><p>You can a achieve a high number of requests: 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD requests <strong>per second per prefix.</strong></p>

<li>Using <strong>SSE-KMS</strong> to encrypt your objects in S3, you must keep in mind the <strong>KMS limits</strong>.</li>
<li>When you <strong>upload</strong> a file ,you will call <code>GenerateDataKey</code> in the KMS API.</li>
<li>When you <strong>download</strong> a file, you will call <code>Decrypt</code> in the KMS API.</li>
<li>Uploading/downloading will count toward the <strong>KMS quota.</strong></li>
<li>Region-specific, however, it;s either 5,500, 10,000 or 30,000 requests per second.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>开头</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>物联网，人们离不开 technological devices 了</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>过一段时间等功能完善了再买会比较明智 </p>
<p>Firstly, it is wise to buy the device later when its deficiencies get fixed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>新出来的产品，往往会不完善。用户多了，提问题给他们，问题解决了，手机就完美了。</p>
<p>It is because when a new technological device is available to the public for the first time, there may well be several inconspicuous imperfections existing in it. With the growing number of users reporting the problems to the manufacturers, the following version is bound to be better than its predecessor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>IPhone 4，信号不好。</p>
<p>Taking iPhone4 for example, this product suffered sharp criticism over signal-receiving problems caused by its poorly-design antenna. </p>
</li>
<li><p>等一段时间，稳定了，名扬天下了。</p>
<p>After rounds of adjustments, the later versions of iPhone4 gradually became stable in function and earned its worldwide reputation.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>新出来的产品价格普遍比较高，等一段时间后价格会回归理性。 </p>
<p>Secondly,the price of a newly launched technological device is relatively higher, which means the quality-price ratio is not satisfactory when people buy it at the very beginning. </p>
</li>
<li><p>经济学讲，上来会短缺，价格会很高。</p>
<p>According to laws of economics, when popular device is firstly brought to the market, the supply falls short of demand, which results in a higher price than its real value, but after a period of time, the price will return to a reasonable level. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Surface，上来价格很高，大家买不起。</p>
<p>For example, the initial price for Surface, a product by Microsoft, was set at around $600 that is unaffordable to most people. </p>
</li>
<li><p>三个月后，价格下降，更理性了。</p>
<p>3 month later, the price was cut down to ​300 that is much more reasonable. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>结尾</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To put it in a nutshell, I prefer to buy a technological device after many people begin to use them. As an old saying goes, good things are worth waiting. Facing a new fascinating technological device, we are advised to wait until the price comes down and the quality becomes better. </li>

<p>1）to evaluate teachers’ performance by students<br>2）to evaluate teachers’ performance by teachers<br>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>三个理由</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>学生接触老师比老师接触老师时间长，所以更能知道老师水平</li>
<li>老师应该回应学生，而不是回应同行</li>
<li>能帮老师省时间</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>开头</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A teacher is generally regarded by many an authoritative role in teaching activities and being a teacher requires solid academic ground in the subject which the teacher specializes in. Therefore, teachers’ teaching performance should be assessed by teachers, who have been trained in teaching methodology and thus are more professional in evaluating process. However, as far as I’m concerned, it is more useful for schools to collect information about teachers’ performance and allocate rewards to those who perform well based on students’ evaluations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>中间段1</strong><ul>
<li>To start off, it is more reasonable and effective if students evaluate teachers’ teaching performance. Because students are the direct receivers in everyday teaching activities. They are better acquainted with their teachers’ teaching performance either in teaching expertise or teaching styles. They can judge whether their teachers’ methods are effective for them or not in a long run. Whereas, other teachers are not able to know well the teacher’s teaching performance by attending only one demo class of the teacher being evaluated. Since a teacher’s overall performance shouldn’t and can’t be assessed merely through several class demonstrations, evaluation for teachers’ performance from their colleague teachers shouldn’t be seen as reasonable and valid enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>中间段2</strong><ul>
<li>In addition, teachers are supposed to respond to students, not to their colleagues nor supervisors. An experienced teacher should prepare teaching materials and give assignments based on students’ learning abilities. Teaching adjustment is always necessary in making lesson plan. This process, however, may conflict with the standard curriculum plan that schools assign. In this case, the teacher will probably choose to conform to the standard lesson plan to appeal to his or her peers and the school’s authority if his or her teaching performance is evaluated by them. Therefore, it is essential to design a valid evaluation system to incentivize teachers to respond to students rather than others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>中间段3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, evaluation through students can save a lot of time and effort for other teachers. For example, In Chinese schools, each teacher typically has to deal with over fifty students each class. Therefore, it will be a nuisance to pay detailed attention toward all other teachers on how they teach students, and this is under the assumption that they want to evaluate their peers in a fair and just manner. Since students have already spent so much time with their educators, they can easily come to conclusions on how good or bad their teachers are. In this sense, students can be more inclined to make fair evaluations compared to other teachers. </li>

What action parents should take do you think will have the most positive effect on children to help them be have better like respecting and treating others kindly?</h4><p>1）limit the types of the TV programs and movies they watch</p>
<p>2）spend more time talking with children</p>
<p>3）supervise and monitor children while they are playing with their friends</p>
<p>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, for parents, sacrificing their spare time to actively and friendly communicate with their children is a more effective way.</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending more time deeply communicating with them, parents can better understand their children and exert positive guidance. Correspondingly, their children also tend to accept their suggest, or even criticism rather than roughly ignore it.</li>
<li>By comparison with the second one, the other two ways in the three options are somewhat unfriendly and compulsory, which would backfire. Generally speaking, children may develop a rebellious mentality if their parents are too strict with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, faced with children’s undesirable behavior habits, compared with mandatory measures, such as limiting the types of TV programs or movies, and monitoring their interactions with their friends, directly speaking to or chatting with them in person is a tender and amiable way and as well as more effective and less side-effect way.</p>

<ul>
<li>参加志愿服务活动可以培养学生的<strong>社会责任感（cultivate the sense of responsibility）</strong>。因为在做志愿服务的过程中，会帮助那些需要帮助的人，或者是帮助一些机构解决问题，比如美化环境，清扫街道等，这会让学生感觉自己是社会的一份子，这可以让他们实现个人的社会价值。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的<strong>社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)</strong>。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得<strong>减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）</strong>从而帮助他们<strong>获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）</strong>。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

<p><strong>老师精力有限 学生注意力难集中</strong></p>
<p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>

<p>— asking parents to help stop the students from cheating</p>
<p>— penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>— asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated”</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is <strong>stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, <strong>students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price</strong> to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can <strong>help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules</strong> whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, <strong>it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework</strong> that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>A society needs a <strong>competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills.</strong> Otherwise, it will be unproductive and <em>fall behind the time</em>.

<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>

<p>— choose the members who have totally different ideas</p>
<p>Which would you think is more effective to work with?”</p>
<p>相同的人可以减少交流成本</p>
<p>相同的人可以一起面对困难</p>
<p>It is tempting to think that finishing a project with members who have different ideas could rise the diversity of the team, leading to a better result of the team assignment. Nevertheless, from my perspective, working with people who share similar opinions is a more effective way to achieve success.</p>
<p><strong>On the one hand, teaming up with classmates of a similar kind will reduce the cost of communication, which results from disagreements among team members.</strong> People who share the same character with each other are more likely to reach into an agreement quicker and easier since they share similar logical patterns. On the contrary, it is difficult for the whole group of students to agree with each other, which not only could cause conflicts among members but also waste a significant amount of time for each student during the process of negotiation. My roommate, for instance, once teamed up with her classmate to deliver a presentation in Marketing class. Unfortunately, she and her team member shared an entirely different value and interest. My roommate wanted to force on the finance industry and to make her PowerPoint look more professional. However, her classmate’s only attention was video games, and he insisted on making their presentation more entertain and enjoyable. Eventually, their cooperation went to a dad end. They had to do their whole work again separately a few days before the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, it is almost impossible to find a perfect time of meeting for every team member if they have different thoughts.</strong> The same kind of students is likely to have an identical lifestyle as well. It is not surprising, for example, that hard-working students usually get up early and typically do not stay up late. Nonetheless, people who enjoy night clubs and bars could not regulate themselves as strictly as other students. Taken my own experience as an example, I initially work with six people in my Business Communication class to finish homework. Some people were eager to finish it sooner while others did not want to start it until the deadline. Hard as we tried, we could only not find a proper time for everyone, and our homework was finished in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Admittedly, having a bunch of people who have different ideas could bring the team with fresh thoughts and unique insights of solving problems. Nevertheless, relatively simple schoolwork assigned by teachers, such as a presentation for English class or a Math question, is unlikely to be so complicated that so many different views and creativity are needed.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, no doubt working with people of similar mind is a more efficient method to finish a task because same people usually are more comfortable to communicate and that it will be less exhausting to arrange a suitable time for meeting for each team member.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.testbig.com/independent-toefl-writing-essays/your-teacher-assigns-project-you-and-you-can-select-members-work-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.testbig.com/independent-toefl-writing-essays/your-teacher-assigns-project-you-and-you-can-select-members-work-0</a></p>
<p><strong>First of all, working with similar people can avoid unnecessary arguments, thus promoting efficiency.</strong> Admittedly, appropriate arguments are rewarding, since they might trigger new thoughts and creative ideas. Despite these potential benefits, working with people of different ideas inevitably makes the whole team take the risks of discussing too much time to finish the assignment in time. For example, once I had a homework to conduct a survey about the purchasing power of young people. To my disappointment, my team spent almost half of the given time struggling to select a location to do the survey, which, in my opinion, was merely trifle details worth little attention and could be skipped if working with people of similar thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, mistakes are common in teamwork, even in the team consisting of people with similar thoughts. However, mistakes may be more destructive in the team composed of people with different thoughts.</strong> Imagine a mission not going smoothly as planned, those whose ideas were ignored at the very beginning would make a lot of complaints. <em>Chances are that</em> they might claim that it would be better if their original suggestions were considered. These sorts of complaints are extremely detrimental, since they would spark a situation where members in the team don’t trust one another. On the contrary, if the team is made up of people of similar thoughts, they would possibly stand together firmly and <strong>strive to</strong> address the problem.</p>

<p>政府做的一些指导也没有什么用</p>
<p>Currently, living in a fast-paced society, there is an increasing number of city dwellers suffering from the pressure generated from the excessive workload, consequently, majorities of city dwellers, especially those white-collar, are enslaved by diversified diseases, like cervical diseases, cardiovascular diseases and so on.</p>
<p><strong>To begin with, governments have done little in arousing public’s awareness to develop a healthy diet.</strong> That’s why bad eating habits are ubiquitous around us. For instance, fast food restaurants like McDonald’s are always crowded where junk food is served, ranging from burgers, French Fries to cola which are high in fat and sugar. People can easily gain weight if eating too much of that. Besides, every time I visit my grandmother’s home, she treats me a full table with delicious dishes, like braised pork, steamed beef and roast mutton but no vegetables. Although meat in Chinese tradition shows hospitality, to some degree, it indicates my grandmother’s lack of awareness about what a balanced diet is. Based on such prevalent phenomena, some practical approaches should be implemented by governments to increase people’s motivation to eat healthily, such as printing some booklets with tips of how to eat healthily and foods containing good nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>The government’s guidelines are vague, though nutritional advice generally isn’t.</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Sherman, a medical school professor and biochemist at Georgetown University, points to the guidelines’ heavy influence on what foods and serving sizes are included in the national school lunch program, as well as what products can be purchased using benefits from the Women, Infants and Children and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs.</p>
<p>Still, he said, the government has struggled over the years to present the guidelines in a way that they are easily understandable and usable, creating a gray area filled in by an “industry of experts” who “interpret, critique, rephrase or reimagine the guidelines,” making them particularly difficult to follow in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>And this is despite the fact that the guidelines have not changed much since the government first began offering nutrition advice many decades ago. The heart of the message has mostly remained that we should eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and limit our consumption of meat, sugar and salt intake — though the wording has varied.</p>
<p>“I think the average person would have a very difficult time just making sense of it,” Sherman told The Huffington Post. “It’s difficult to go shopping with the guidelines in your hand and do meal planning.”</p>

<ul>
<li>参加志愿服务活动可以培养学生的<strong>社会责任感（cultivate the sense of responsibility）</strong>。因为在做志愿服务的过程中，会帮助那些需要帮助的人，或者是帮助一些机构解决问题，比如美化环境，清扫街道等，这会让学生感觉自己是社会的一份子，这可以让他们实现个人的社会价值。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的<strong>社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)</strong>。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得<strong>减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）</strong>从而帮助他们<strong>获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）</strong>。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

<li>Admittedly, working in a business of your own family do facilitate your adjustment to the company because your relatives will help you know about how the whole system work and maintain quickly.

<p><strong>老师精力有限 学生注意力难集中</strong></p>
<p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>

<p>-penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>-asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated”</p>
<p>Which of the following do you think is the most efficient way to stop?</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>(2)spend more time talking with children</p>
<p>(3)supervise and monitor children while they are playing with their friends</p>
<p>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, for parents, sacrificing their spare time to actively and friendly communicate with their children is a more effective way.</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending more time deeply communicating with them, parents can better understand their children and exert positive guidance. Correspondingly, their children also tend to accept their suggest, or even criticism rather than roughly ignore it.</li>
<li>By comparison with the second one, the other two ways in the three options are somewhat unfriendly and compulsory, which would backfire. </li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, faced with children’s undesirable behavior habits, compared with mandatory measures, such as limiting the types of TV programs or movies, and monitoring their interactions with their friends, directly speaking to or chatting with them in person is a tender and amiable way and as well as more effective and less side-effect way.</p>

<li>However, it is unwise to give too much money once a time when children get a good grade, since that will miss lead the children to be money oriented. But the goal is to encourage them to work hard and put a little pressure on them and at the same time make sure they are not going to be luxury. I will be fun to do so.</li>

<p>A society needs a competent workforce equipped with up-to-date skills. Otherwise, it will be unproductive and fall behind the time. However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a borderline pass than to be a success program.</p>

<li>Besides, financial thinking as an important skill is useful to the modern society, meaning that parents ought to teach the children how to manage their own money.</li>
<li>However, it is unwise to give too much money once a time when children get a good grade, since that will miss lead the children to be money oriented. But the goal is to encourage them to work hard and put a little pressure on them and at the same time make sure they are not going to be luxury. I will be fun to do so.</li>

<ul>
<li>To start with, to work in an irrelevant company gives you a lot of freedom of choice since personal emotions and family relationship will not be taken into consideration when you make decisions.</li>
<li>And besides, working for a business owned by strangers provides you a bunch of chances to expanding your social network instead of working with a lot of relatives.</li>
<li>Admittedly, working in a business of your own family do facilitate your adjustment to the company because your relatives will help you know about how the whole system work and maintain quickly. However, if viewed from another angle, this point of view seems not plausible enough for one to choose family business, because if you have favorable communication ability, one could become acquaintance with colleagues and they are willing to help too.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, facing the choice between working in family business and competing independently in job market, people should opt for the latter one.</p>

<p>2) Spend more time talking with children</p>
<p>3) Supervise and monitor children while they are playing with their friends</p>
<p>In my opinion, for parents, sacrificing their spare time to actively and friendly communicate with their children is a more effective way.</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending more time deeply communicating with them, parents can better understand their children and exert positive guidance. Correspondingly, their children also tend to accept their suggest, or even criticism rather than roughly ignore it.</li>
<li>By comparison with the second one, the other two ways in the three options are somewhat unfriendly and compulsory, which would backfire. </li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, faced with children’s undesirable behavior habits, compared with mandatory measures, such as limiting the types of TV programs or movies, and monitoring their interactions with their friends, directly speaking to or chatting with them in person is a tender and amiable way and as well as more effective and less side-effect way.</p>

What they learn in this period will become a huge factor that determining their whole life to a great extent. In order to better use this golden time, some education institution advocate that students are supposed to learn as many subjects as possible at this time. However, I don’t think it is a smart move to do so. Instead, studying three or four subjects at a time would serve them better.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, only three or four subjects at a time will ensure that students have enough time and energy for each of subjects to make further research to gain the thorough and deep understanding.</li>
<li>And besides, when students are allow to choose three or four subjects at a time based on their own interest, they would perform better without under the huge amount of mental pressure.</li>
<li>What can not be denied is that there are such versatile geniuses who can easily cope with many subjects at one time without any difficulty. However, only a small fraction of students have this talent. For the most of the high school students, only pursue the quantity of subjects not quality will definitely backfire. </li>

Which idea do you support?</h4><p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to children’s education, we are undergoing a stage where children’s extra-curriculum are playing significant role. Thus, this phenomenon triggers an grave concern about whether teenagers should take part in this kind of activities such as musical and sports. In my opinion, it is very necessary for teenagers to be engaged in this variety activities. And my reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, getting involved in more activities can be conducive to the well-rounded development of students. <ul>
<li>It is self-evident that different activities can equip participants with various skills and abilities.<ul>
<li>To illustrate this point of view, students attending musical concerts can learn how to appreciate the melodies and concertos of musical masterpieces and thus improve their aesthetic capability.</li>
<li>Similarly, the team sports will help students cultivate a sense of cooperation and collective sense of honor.</li>
<li>So, after having obtained the above skills, students will definitely can develop in an all-rounded way, with the result if becoming more competitive than others in the society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In contrast, specializing in only one kind of activity is a totally different picture. This kind of cultivation sometimes will backfire. It means that, if one is only be fostered in one field, his future development will face potential obstacles and difficulties. And the underlying reason is that the more and more complicated modern life necessitate the comprehensive prerequisite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, taking part in many after-class activities can do better job in helping students find what they are really interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, we can draw a conclusion that it is a wiser move for students to attend multiple activities in different fields, in order to obtain a holistic development and find what fascinate them most.</p>

<p>2) Preserve the natural places like forests and protect the animals that live there.</p>
<p>3) Enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water by large companies.</p>
<p>Taking a panoramic view of human history, we can readily find that the natural environment plays and enormously important role in determining the future of each and every country.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, spending money in developing new energy which is friendly to environment can radically solve the various problems triggered by environment changes.<ul>
<li>影响工业</li>
<li>影响环境同样影响人 respiratory disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, there are conspicuous limitation of the other two options, because both of them will bring some notable side-effect which possibly will backfire.<ul>
<li>保护动物只能暂时解决问题，不是长远之计</li>
<li>并不是所有国家都有实力不排放并且保持经济增长，保护环境损失经济，同样不可取</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that funding research of environmental friendly energy will more preferable, because not only it is the pragmatic key  to solving the environmental problems comprehensively, but also has little side-effect.</p>

<p>2) Provide additional training in teaching effectively for high school teachers,using online material that each teacher will study individually. </p>
<p>Nowadays, with the booming attention to the education, will are on the stage that improving the teachers skill become a pressing matter of the moment. Thus, this kind of situation triggers a grave concern about which way to improve teacher’s skill is pragmatic and feasible. In my opinion, I incline to state that the best approach to enhance training of teachers is to provide every teacher with the training courses through the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, face-to-face training courses could only serve a small scale of teachers and information passed on by them to other teachers might be incomplete or even worse because of inattention or forgetfulness, beside, these group of teacher also need time to absorb what they have learned from the courses.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the online training course is more convenient and more practical for teachers.</li>
<li>Some educational experts claim that face-to-face training is superior to online course because they allow all the attendee to discuss afterwards. However , if viewed from another angle, actually, online course is capable of this also.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from what has been discussed above, we can safely reach the conclusion that it is more advisable to provide training to all the teacher online since it is more pragmatic and more effective than face-to-face training provided bu experts.</p>

<p>2) penalty or punishment to the students</p>
<p>3) asking teacher to create homework assignment that cannot be easily cheated</p>
<p>Now, the education institutions are in a stage that cheating as a serious problem become a press matter of the moment. So, this phenomenon triggers a grave discussion on how to oppose cheating. In my opinion, The second one, which is stepping up efforts to penalty to the cheating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, if schools increase the punishment, students would not dare to cheat once they recognize that they have to pay a high price to do so, and school will receive quick returns with this method.</li>
<li>Furthermore, this kind of methods can help cultivate students the sense of integrity and foster their conception of abidance of the rules whether in a school or in a society.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it is difficult either for parents to effectively supervise children’s behavior or for teachers to design homework that is impossible or difficult to cheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can readily reach the conclusion that to cope with there increasing number of students who cheat in homework, school’s best choice is to impose the severe penalty on those who dare to cross the line. This is the most effective method to force them to willingly regulate behaviors by themselves.</p>

<p>Friendship is a huge constituent part of a wonderful life, and everyone long for a long-lasting time of relationship with friends. So, this kind of aspiration triggers an interesting discussion about what is the most significant factor in determining the last time of friendship. In my opinion, I incline to state that the common interest is the vital key to a long lasting relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, having the same interests is the basic guarantee to have mutual interest topic to talk to each other, which definitely will lead to many memorable experiences.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it seems that helping others in emergency and mutual trust are also related to the lasting time of friendship. But the fact is both of them are not the fundamental  reason for this, instead, they are the superficial causes. Beyond these superficial causes, the fundamental cause could trace back to the common interest. Because spending a lot of time together is the prerequisite to a well developed friendship which lead to further help in emergency and mutual trust. From this point of view, helping each other when one is in emergency and trusting each other completely are the result of a long lasting friendship, not the factor of the lasting time of the friendship.</li>

However, when the administration spends money on a nationwide work skills development training program where eligible trainees are only adults at the age of 25 or older, it should not expect the desired return.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the age of 25 may be a late point of start. Instead, an earlier age would be far desirable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the nationwide scale is too wide to be pragmatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we have discussed above, we can readily draw a conclusion that I hardly can be optimistic about the effectiveness of the program. I think it is more likely to be a failure or a borderline pass than to be a success program.</p>

It is common that young people are easy to get excited with the dream and impulsively pursuing the dream. However, I insist that people should always focus on the realistic goals. My reasons and examples are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ambitious goal may be a great rallying cry, but it is hard to sustain the motivation of pursuing one over a long time, because eventually you will get tired and realize that the goal is to hard to reach and finally you will stop striving for it and the process will slide into stagnant.</li>
<li>Achievable and realistic goals are good indication of a huge plan, and it can provide satisfaction and motivation when one achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what we discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that achievable goals are therefore superior to ones which are too extreme huge because they are not only offer you a distinct record of the process you have made towards a larger plan, but also provide the motivation which could prevent you from sliding into stagnant. </p>

<p>2) students must volunteer to work in the city where the university is located  or their hometowns to improve some aspects of life of the city or their own town.</p>
<p>which one do you think is more beneficial for students in their university. Why?</p>
<p>Schools should require students to volunteer on the projects in the university’s city or hometown.</p>

<li>参加志愿服务活动可以培养学生的社会责任感（cultivate the sense of responsibility）。因为在做志愿服务的过程中，会帮助那些需要帮助的人，或者是帮助一些机构解决问题，比如美化环境，清扫街道等，这会让学生感觉自己是社会的一份子，这可以让他们实现个人的社会价值。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以促进学生的社交能力 (facilitate their social interaction)。因为在活动的过程中他们需要学会如何与周围的人相处得融洽（get along well with other people），如何表达得加得体（how to express properly），如何解决棘手的问题（how to deal with thorny problems）。</li>
<li>参加志愿服务活动还可以适当得减少学生的课程压力（alleviate their pressure on courses）从而帮助他们获得好的学习成绩（which assists with their test performance）。因为在做志愿活动时，学生可以得到适当的休息，同时，社会活动的经历也让他们明白，只有通过努力，才能让自己立足在这个充满竞争的社会中（only by making painstaking efforts on study can they keep a favorable position in the society full of fierce competition），因此学生就会在学习上取得好的成绩。</li>

Some people suggest it would benefit young students to be taught by different teachers. Do you agree with this view? Why or why not?</h4><p>I agree with this statement that younger students will benefit from being taught by several different teacher every day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers have limited time and energy. If they are to teach students all day long, they will be too tired to guarantee the teaching quality.</p>
<p>老师的时间和精力有限。如果一整天都不休息，一直给学生上课，这样老师会很累，教学效果也不好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is much harder for younger students to concentrate themselves. If they are taught by only one teacher all the day, the newness (the feeling of freshness and attraction) will soon wears off and they will feel bored, shifting their attention to something more interesting.</p>
<p>年纪更小的学生更难集中注意力。如果一整天都是一个老师在上课，学生很快就没有新鲜感，觉得无聊，注意力很快就会转移到其它更有趣的地方。</p>
</li>
<li><p>有的人说一个老师更容易产生依赖。但这是好事吗？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I do believe that elementary students should also be taught different subjects by different teachers.</p>
<p>总之，我认为，位于小学教育阶段的学生也应该由不同老师来教授不同科目。</p>

<li><strong>umm, this is because, you know,</strong> the university is in no financial position of doing so,</li>
<li><strong>and also,</strong> the sculpture is actually quite large, so it will take up all the green space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the women didn’t like this idea,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>this is because, umm, actually,</strong> the university didn’t pay for the sculpture , there is a donor donating this to the university.</li>
<li><strong>also</strong> she know why this students didn’t like this sculpture<strong>, this is because, you know,</strong> he can’t play soccer in that green area anymore, and for him, he doesn’t want to move.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, the university plans to eliminate the bus service.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>uum, this is because</strong> only few students ride it and also it is kind of expensive to operate it.</li>
<li><strong>uum, on top of that,</strong> the money saved by eliminate the bus could be used to expand the parking lots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the man did not like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>He thinks that</strong> the route of the bus is out of date, and this is why students didn’t take the bus. <strong>you know,</strong> the bus only go through the expensive neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>and the students also didn’t like the idea of</strong> expanding the parking spaces, because this will encourage more students to drive, which will add more noise and you know students will end up needing more parking spaces.</li>

<li><strong><em>However, the women does not like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in the cold morning, students will love to have some hot cereal rather than cold yogurt.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> the women doesn’t think this can help them to save money, because if school doesn’t offer hot breakfast, students have to go to off-campus places to get them.</li>

<li><strong>This is because</strong> this action can strengthen the relationship between school and town.</li>
<li><strong>and also,</strong> it can help students to discover the love of doing the service that can inspire them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the men doesn’t like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>He think</strong> it will hurt the relation between the school and the town. Because students will see the volunteer as the chore and do it without enthusiastic and also do not put their heart into it. So, this can not make the things better.</li>
<li><strong>Besides,</strong> he said that students will have negative feelings because they already have enough time.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>However, the women doesn’t like this idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> she think the new lights are not bright enough, so the students will turn on the reading lamps, in this way, any saving will go away.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the woman said that the library will become less comfortable on hot days if the air conditioning is reduced, so students will go back to dorm, and dorm’s study environment is not as good as the library because of the noisy.</li>

<li><strong><em>And, in the conversation, the man really like the idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> <strong>he thinks that</strong> it is kind of expensive for students to buy new books. On campus, there are a few used ones. <strong>By having this list earlier,</strong> students can buy online to save money.</li>

<li><strong>First of all,</strong> she said that, without these posters, the student center just a boring build. You know, nothing about it is interesting. But a lot of posters are artistic and they give building some personalities and some characters.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the women doesn’t like the idea that using the bulletin in dining hall, because not everyone eat in the dining hall. So, some students will not able to see these announcements.</li>

<li><strong>And also,</strong> the orientation program will only last for 1 day, not 2 days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>You know, the man really likes the idea.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> he says that, not everyone like the same thing, like he didn’t like sleeping in a tent, so that is why he didn’t go to his orientation program.</li>
<li><strong>Also,</strong> with this new program, students just don’t have to give up the whole weekend. You know, there are often busy during the weekend like buying books like so on. And the big time commitment used to get in the way.</li>

<li><strong><em>While the reading passage talks about the group think,</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> the individual members try to conform their opinion to what they believe to be group consensus, even though the result could be negative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example, the professor suggest that a design makeover for the company’s product,</em></strong><ul>
<li>at first, more than half of people support his idea, but one senior manager did not like his idea because he said the focus should be on the technology not on the design, suddenly, people start to change their attitude, because they don’t want to disagree with the manager. Eventually, most people decided to stay with the current design. Unfortunately, the competitor at that year, came out a new design that attracted some of their customers.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example for group think.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about audience effect.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>It means that</strong> individual at work is effected by the knowledge that they are being visible to others.</li>
<li><strong>uum, for example,</strong> there are two groups of students who are putting on their shoes, the first group are told that they were observed, and the second group, they didn’t know they are observed. And for the results, the group one tight their shoes faster.</li>
<li><strong>While another example is about</strong> how to type, if we know there are some people are observing us, we tend to type faster, at the same time, interestingly, we may also to make more mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are two examples to explain the idea of audience effect.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about cognitive dissonant.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> discomfort by conflict between the one’s believes and one’s action.</li>
<li><strong>for example,</strong> the professor was addicted to the video game in high school, so he doesn’t perform well in the chemistry. Then he just had this conflict, because he thought he has to do well in all subjects if he want to succeed in futures. In order to solve this conflict, the professor changed his perspective, since he didn’t want to be a chemist, he realize that chemistry didn’t matter, he just have to do well in sociology because he want to be a sociologist. So, he reinterpret the situation to solve the conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is the good example to explain the cognitive dissonant.</strong></li>

<li><strong>you know, it means that</strong> company will solve the problem in a long-term, considering the interaction of different parts contributing to the problem.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor used to work in a company where workers were absent a lot. So, the company hire a consultant to solve the problem. So, they did a lot of research, such as interview a lot of employees, as well as research on the eating facilities and health service. Then they found that, worker missed their work because of the health problem, you know, they are lack of exercises, so the consultant suggested that company could build a gym and offer more nutritious menu at cafeteria. And about a year late, attendance were no longer a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example to explain the system thinking.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about chaining behavior</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know,</strong> it is a technique used by parents to teach kinds how to do a complex behavior.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor taught her daughter how to wash hand. First, he divided this behavior into five small steps, turning on the water, wetting hands, putting on soap, washing hands and turning off water, so first, he taught her daughter step one, and he taught her daughter step two when she can do step one herself and ask her to do both step one and step two. And so on, he taught her daughter step three, four and five, and ask her daughter to practicing all the steps a few days. Eventually, her daughter can wash her hands all by her self.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, the professor talks about procedural memories.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>Which is means</strong> the memories of the process of performing a task that become automatic with practice.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor took a guitar lesson when he was young. During the class, his teacher show him how to hold the guitar, where to play his finger on the string. When he back home, he would play for hours everyday. So, the professor could pick up the guitar and play a son without thinking. But then, he stop playing for years. But on day, when he found his old guitar, he realized that he still knew how to play every song.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, it is a good example to explain the procedural memories.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about optimal foraging.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that</strong> at most try to minimize the energy they expend in foraging process and maximizing the nutrition benefits.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> There is kind of birds that eats shell fish. So it dive into the water to catch the shell fish and carry it into the air so as to drop it to let it open. And this birds select the biggest birds available because this action can make sure they get the biggest possible meal. And besides, the birds also carry the fish to a certain height and then drop it, because if it goes any lower, it may have to drop it again and any higher altitude seem unnecessary to them and just the waste of energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, the bird is a good example to explain the optimal foraging.</strong></li>

<h4 id="【TPO-47】Reactance"><a href="#【TPO-47】Reactance" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 47】Reactance"></a>【TPO 47】Reactance</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about reactance.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that</strong> individual desire to reestablish the freedom and to control the situation.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> like a kids, he likes to play at a playground, but his parent won’t want him to play in there anymore. But still, the kids will snick to play despite the rules.</li>
<li><strong>And a second example is about</strong> banning a certain kind of soap. People are really upset about this decision because they though they should be able to buy whatever they want. So, before the actual ban, a lot of people went to store and bought a lot of soap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>So, these are two examples to explain the reactance.</strong></li>

<h4 id="【TPO-46】Warning-Correlation"><a href="#【TPO-46】Warning-Correlation" class="headerlink" title="【TPO 46】Warning Correlation"></a>【TPO 46】Warning Correlation</h4><ul>
<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage is talking about warning correlation.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that</strong> animals, they have distinct coloring that signal predators of the defense mechanism they have.</li>
<li><strong>For example, the skunk. </strong>They have a black body, they also have a white stripe running from their head to the tail. And skunk, they can produce horrible smell liquid to protect themselves. </li>
<li><strong>So for example,</strong> when a wolf approaches to a skunk, it will just spread the liquid to the wolf. And the wolf would just back off because of that terrible smelling liquid. So, in the future, if the wolf see a white stripe again, it will force the wolf to recall the terrible smell and it would stay far away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is a good example to illustrate warning correlation.</strong></li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about method of loci.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means</strong> a technique to remember several pieces of information in a particular order.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> someone has to remember the sequence of planet in the order of their distance from the sun.</li>
<li><strong>So this person can</strong> imagine the walk from dormitory to the students center. So, the first land mark is the door and the second land mark is the beautiful tree, and a statue.</li>
<li><strong>So to</strong> remember the name of planets, this person can assign one planet to each land mark. Like mercury with the door and Venus with the tree and so on. </li>
<li><strong>So, in the test,</strong> when he needs to recall this information, he can just imagine the walk from the dorm to the student center.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, the reading passage talks about scope creep.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>You know, it means that,</strong> as the project progresses, clients may ask for more  than the business originally expected to provide.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the professor has a construction company.</li>
<li>The company was hired to build a wooden fence for a lady. They made a verbal agreement and they didn’t put anything in writing. Later, when the job was almost done, the lady said she wanted the fence to be painted white. But the professor’s friends thought he was hired to build the fence, not to paint the fence in addition. But eventually, he just agreed to paint but he was not happy about it.</li>

<li><strong><em>While, there are two types of factors that can cause population changes.</em></strong><ul>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> biotic factors, which are living factors that can influence the size of population.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> mice and awl, since awls eat mice. So, the number of mice depend on the number of awl. And one year, awls are more than usual, so the number of mice drops.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>And the other fact is called</strong> abiotic factor, which are the non-living things in the environment.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> rabbits. They often start to have their young in the end of the winter. But one year, the winter season are really short, so the rabbits can start to reproduce much earlier. As a result, the number of rabbits increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong><em>While, in this lecture, the professor talks about that</em></strong> the babies are actually have the ability of mathematics.<ul>
<li><strong>To be more specific,</strong> he believe that the baby can add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>For example the professor</em></strong> introduce a experiment.<ul>
<li>A baby was shown a doll, and then the researchers are lower the screen to hide the doll. Next the researcher took another doll and act obviously behind the screen to make sure the baby saw that, but after this the researchers secretly took away one doll and raise up the screen. And baby was surprised by just seen one doll behind the screen which should be two.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two definitions of money.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> a narrow one to definite money. Money could be considered as coins or bills.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the person 5 dollars to taxis driver in order to purchase a ride, and the the taxis driver may give the farmer 5 dollars to purchase the vegetables. So, this is the narrow definition of money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, there is</strong> a broad definition of money, which is that the good or services are use to exchange for other goods or services.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the taxis driver may use a drive to exchange for the vegetables from a farmer.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two strategies of advertising.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong>  repetition.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in a car commercial prefer to the roomy cars, this car just keep picking up people, and every time when someone gets on, a person said plenty room for friends, or plenty room for family. So, by being repeating that, the people will be convinced that the car is spacious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another strategy is</strong> to use celebrities.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> a celebrities in a car said that I like my car being fast. Then, in this case, the people will believe that the car is impressive for its speed.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two factors about animal’s biological cycle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> the internal clock.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the flying squeals, they flying during the night and sleep during the night. But if they are not exposed to the sunlight, they can still maintain the activity pattern. This is because their internal clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another factors is</strong> external cue.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> after this constant darkness, the flying squeals are exposed to daylight. At first, their schedule can not match up, they will wake up at the mid night. But after a while, the external cue and help them to adjust the internal clock until they go back to normal activity cycle.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two ways to prevent food spoilage and why they are effective.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first way is to</strong> control the temperature<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> the fresh fish, if it is left out under the sunlight, it would spoiled in hours, but if we freeze it, it could be kept for month. </li>
<li><strong>It is because</strong> the low temperature can slow down the bacteria growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another way is to</strong> control the moisture.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> the regular milk, it spoils really quickly, but milk in powder form can last for years. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> without moisture and water condition, the bacteria can not grow.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two disadvantages of living in groups.</li>
<li><strong>The  first one is that,</strong> they are more visible to predators.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> sardines, they often swim in groups, so, the whales, well their predators, probably wouldn’t notice one sardine. But, whale could easily a group of sardines and eat them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another</strong> disadvantage has to do with caring for the young.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> millions of bats lives in a cave, so a mother bat returns from finding food, she might feed the baby of another mother bat. In this case, her own baby couldn’t get fed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are</strong> two disadvantages of living in group for animals.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two ways that advertising may negatively affect the environments.</li>
<li><strong>While, the first case is that,</strong> it could be wasting of natural resources.<ul>
<li>Like once, the advertising kitchen renovation service, it is all waste of papers and trees, because the whole book is irrelevant to the professor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, you know,</strong> sometimes the advertising will negatively affect the natural beauty.<ul>
<li>For example, you can see some big ads on the side of the road when passing through a mountain. In this case, people can not just appreciate the beauty of the environment because the big ads get in the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>So, these are two ways that</strong> advertising can negatively affect the environment.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two benefits of animal domestication for early humans.</li>
<li><strong>The first one is</strong> providing human with consistent meat.<ul>
<li>Like goats were domesticated, and they are able to move from place to place. So, when early human need meat. They can provide consistent and reliable meats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The another one is</strong> that they can supply a variety of foods other than meat.<ul>
<li>Like domesticated goats could produce milk, so early human can collect it and drink it. They can also process the milk into cheese or yogurt, which could be stored.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about two</strong> explanation why we may remember some things better than others.</li>
<li><strong>The first case is</strong> we remember better if we have previous knowledge.<ul>
<li><strong>Let’s say</strong> someone goes to a classic concert, you know, if the person knows the classic music a lot, it is much easier for one to recall the details of the concert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another thing is that</strong> we remember better if there is something special.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> in a class with more than one hundred students. People can remember someone who is tall or someone who is intelligent. Because this features make them easy to be remembered.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> how producing electricity benefit the fish.</li>
<li><strong>The first benefit is that</strong> this can help the fish to capture the prey.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the electric eel, it can produce a strong electric current. So, when it finds the food, it would just shock the fish and make sure it can get the food.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another benefit is that</strong> producing electricity can help the fish to navigate their environment.<ul>
<li><strong>Like,</strong> the knife fish, it creates electrical field around it. So, when it swim around a rock, it would sense the interference, so it can swim around the rock and avoid  crashing into it.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor talks about</strong> two benefits of forest fires for animals.</li>
<li><strong>The first one is that</strong> forest fires could make it easier for predator to find food.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> wild turkeys, they usually just wait at the edge of forest fire. They just wait for insects escaping from it. So, in this case, they can easily gather a lot of foods. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another benefits is that</strong> forest fires can make the forest a good place for animal developments.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> like some trees, their are poisonous for some beetles.  But after the fire, the trees are died, so the beetles can easily and safely lay eggs, and young beetles can use the tree as nourishment.</li>

<li><strong>While, the professor mainly talks about two different ways</strong> in which animals provide themselves with food.</li>
<li><strong>The first one</strong> is that animals may cultivate plants.<ul>
<li><strong>Like danzo fish,</strong> they likes to eat  a kind of sea weed. So, basically, they will provide protection to sea weeds. If they see some plants block the sunlight from the sea weeds, they would just bite them off. In this case, the sea weeds could grow and danzo fish can have a lot to eat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Besides, another one is that</strong> animals may take care of other animals.<ul>
<li><strong>Like</strong> black ants, they take care of aphids, because aphids can provide sweet liquids that they eat. So, ants will guard them, and even raise their young. So, in this case, ant could make aphids as a reliable resources of foods. </li>

<li><strong>While, honesty,</strong> if someone tries rock climbing, it could be a sign of bravery or it could be a sign of stupidity.</li>
<li><strong>While, for example, if I try rock climbing,</strong> it will be very stupid, because I am not professional athlete, so I’m not fit enough, so doing this rock climbing, I may fall and get hurt. While I just don’t think it is worth trying.</li>
<li><strong>And besides, if some professional athlete tries rock climbing,</strong> it could be a sign of bravery. While this is because they are pushing their bodies to the limit, and they are trying to make impossible possible. So, I think it’s quite inspiring.</li>

<li><strong>While, I think it is better to</strong> receive positive news.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> my life is already depressing enough, you know, I work a lot, and I am under a lot of tress. So, receiving such positive news can easily cheer me up. It can make me believe that life is actually wonderful.</li>
<li><strong>While however, I think sometimes, we do need to</strong> hear about the negative news.</li>

<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> be taught by an experienced teacher.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> experienced teacher can teach better. Since they have been teacher so many years. So, he must know what the key points are. During the classes, he can better focus on the key points and provide a lot of example. So, students can better understand it.</li>
<li><strong>And besides, experienced teachers are better because</strong> they can better communicate with students, they can even become friends with students. So, I am sure students will love their classes and enjoy the school life.</li>

<li><strong>While, honestly, I don’t think</strong> luck is as important as hard work for a person’s success. This is because, hard work is actually more important.</li>
<li><strong>You know,</strong> in one’s career, if he or she is hard working, this person can totally improve himself or herself.  For example, in the business industry, if he works really hard, he can improve his problem solving skill. He can also learn how to communicate with clients effectively. And this can help a person to be more successful.</li>
<li><strong>Besides,</strong> if one is hard working, he or she can leave a great impression to the boss. So, in this case, he or she would likely to be promoted to a higher position.</li>
<li><strong>While, however,</strong> it might be true that luck can dramatically changes one’s life, but it is not wise to bet on luck.</li>
<li><strong>So, because of these reasons,</strong> I think hard work is more important.</li>

<li><strong>While, to be honest, I think</strong> people should be allowed to take photos when visiting a museum.</li>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> photos we took at the museum can help us to recall the vivid memory and momentous time.</li>
<li><strong>Like me,</strong> I love Vincent van Gogh so much that I took a photo with the painting  Starry Night over the Rhone in the Orsay museum and many years later, I can still remember the time I spent in that museum, standing in front of this painting, marveling at his painting skills and being immersed in his fantasy world he drew on the canvas.</li>
<li><strong>Besides,</strong> if we do not use flash light when shooting the photos, we would not harm the exhibits at all and also we would not disturb other visitors at all.</li>
<li><strong>So, because of these reasons, I think</strong> we, visitors, should be allowed to take photos when visiting a museum. </li>

<li><strong>While, to be honest, I don’t agree that</strong> being polite is more important than being truthful.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> being polite is a communication skill, but being truthful is an essential characteristic or a merit everyone should possesses. And to some extent, being truthful is a crucial part of an high-quality communication or conversation. This is because,  being truthful can help both sides of a conversation to create a congenial climate that is conducive to reach a consensus.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, being truthful can</strong> help one to earn (assist in earning) others’ respect. When you treat others in good faith, they will also be truthful to you and also respect you which have a beneficial effect on your social activities.</li>
<li><strong>So, because of these reasons, I turn to disagree that</strong> being polite should be give priority.</li>

Others prefer to work in a large company or organization with thousands of employees. Which do you think is better?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> work in a small company or organization with a few workers.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> for an employee, working in a small company will have more chances to be promoted. <strong>It’s not hard to understand,</strong> in a small company, an ordinary employee is easier to reach a high level or a higher position in the company, compared with working in a large company. <strong>The reason is obvious,</strong> the fewer rivals or opponents you have, the higher likelihood you will have to be promoted.</li>
<li><strong>Besides,</strong> Working in a small company is beneficial for one to better make contribution to the company. <strong>The reason is apparent too,</strong> in a small company, one is easier to communicate to the executive level and express one’s own idea without any obstacle. <strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is extremely difficult to meet them by chances, not to mention making your point in front of them.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to</strong> work in a small company, rather than large company with a lot of employees.</li>

<li><strong>Besides, compared with</strong> many business opportunities, a developed educational system can better promote the development of a country in a long term. <strong>Because</strong> a developed educational system can bring innovation and encourage entrepreneurship unceasingly and persistently. <strong>And</strong> innovation and entrepreneurship matter to country’s success.</li>

Some other people prefer to read books &gt;Which way do you prefer? Why?</h4><ul>
<li><strong>While, to be honest, I definitely will choose to</strong> read books rather than read in electronic format.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> reading in paper material is conducive for me to better dive in to the book, <strong>in other words,</strong> to be immersed in the contents. It is not hard to understand, if someone read on the cell phone, he or she would stand a fair chance to be interrupted because others will call in, or a massage is received. So, there are many other thing that will prevent us to enjoy the books.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, anther reason that let me choose</strong> the paper books <strong>is that</strong> electronic devices is detrimental to our physically health. Many youngsters suffer from myopic just because they spend a lot of time in their electronic devices, such as their mobile phones or computers.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, this is why</strong> I love to read books in material, because I don’t need to worry about being disrupted by others as long as I mute my cell phone and put it far away from me.</li>

<li><strong>While, I do not think it is a great idea</strong> to use this green space to build a housing complex.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the city park is the only green space in the city, we should keep it green, rather to transform it into a housing complex. Since that is the case, many dwellers rely on it to relax and hang out with friends.</li>
<li><strong>As for me,</strong> I once lived in a crowd community, and the center garden is the only green place that I used to hang out with others, and a great amount of my precious memories happened in there. If the only green space was devastated by government, I would have no idea to place my childhood.</li>

<li><strong>While, I can not agree that</strong> to succeed we need to make enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Admittedly</strong>, it is true that we will encounter tons of enemies in order to succeed, but it does not mean that we need to make enemies, especially we are already have a lot of enemies.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the best strategy to succeed is to make friends of an enemy. In other words, instead of making more enemies, the best way for us to be successful is to make friends with person that used to be our enemies. If that is the case, we will have more helping hands and fewer obstacles in our way to success. Which means if you can convert an powerful enemy into friends, that will make you ever stronger and even more closer to the success.</li>
<li><strong>Let’s look at the</strong> Los Angeles Lakers in NBA. Kobe Bryant &amp; Shaquille O’Neal , they are two best players in the whole association. And there is no need for them to be enemy if they want the championship. And when O’Neal left the Lakers, It’s much harder for Kobe to win the championship. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I do not agree that we need to make enemies.</strong></li>

<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> save money myself to buy something that I awfully want.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the process of saving money for a long time will make one thing even more precious. Saving money is an arduous process and this exhausting experience will help you to remember how precious it was and I will make this thing worth it at all costs.</li>
<li><strong>By the way,</strong> borrowing money to buy something doesn’t means that we don’t need to pay for it. On the contrary, if we borrow money from the bank, we even need to pay more to buy it eventually, because of the interest and risk of deflation. And we still need to save money to pay my due in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would prefer</strong> saving money to buy one thing that I desire.</li>

<li><strong>And also,</strong> youngsters are not mature enough to distinguish between good and bad. So, they would stand a fair chance to imitate and learn those violence and dirty words in TV program. And that is also a detrimental effect to their bright future.</li>

<p><strong>This is because,</strong> phone calls is more directly and efficient than sending messages. If you want to communicate with or get informations from someone, you could just call them and you will get the answer and whatever you what as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> making phone call can reduce the loss of information and misunderstanding. Because, other can quickly find your misunderstanding and misstatement and correct you during the dialogue in a phone call.</p>

<li><strong>While, to be honest, I prefer to</strong> buy movies or books instead of renting them.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> if I buy a book, in other words, I own a book, I can start reading this book as any time I want. This thing matters to me because I like reading very much, so I sometimes will buy a lot of books. <strong>This practice and habits will lead to a fact that</strong> there are books that I started reading after I bought them for many years. <strong>On the contrary,</strong> if I rent a book, I have to start reading it immediately because of limited time span of borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Besides,</strong> some books and movies are collectible. <strong>This is another reason that I want to buy books and movies.</strong></li>

<li><strong>This is because,</strong> by dealing with different tasks, one can hone and perfect one’s skills persistently and unceasingly.

<li><strong>Besides,</strong> If one has opportunities to deal with different tasks, he or she stands a fair chance to meet a large amount of people.

<li><strong>And besides,</strong> by being a leader, I can make more contributions to the project, than just being a member.

<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> decorate surroundings rather than just keep it simple and free.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> by decorating my surroundings, I would feel more sense of belonging. For example, I used to live in a dormitory in high school and I decorated my dormitory at the first day I had the key of the dorm. And every time I step into my dorm, it feels like going back home and I can better relax myself.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> keeping things I like around me can mobilize myself and energize myself all the time. Every time I feel frustrated and discouraged, I would like to spend a lot of time staring at a painting which is a duplicate of Starry night of the Rhone, an extraordinary works by Vincent van Gogh. This painting will empower me to face the predicaments in life and  pull me back on the rails.</li>

<li><strong>This is because,</strong> I am a college students who is busy as a beaver. When I have a break time between classes, a study hall would really helpful for me to take a break. So, I don’t have to rush back to dormitory to have a rest.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> there wasn’t even a convenient place for students to assemble between classes if there is no study hall in the university.  When we have to accomplish a team work, the study hall is the only place that suitable for us to talk and communicate with each other. You know, library is not a good place to communicate and arguing about the idea, because these conduct may disrupt others who are concentrate on their own works.</li>

<li><strong>While, I prefer that</strong> students should not be required to evaluate their professors at the and of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> at the end to the semester, every students will get a score from their professor according to their performance. But students sometimes will evaluate their professor just according to their own score but not according to their professor’s own performance. That is not fair to the professor. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> students have the right not to evaluate any professor. So, the university should give students the chance to evaluate the professor and at the same time not to ask everyone to evaluate for obligation.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer no to required all students to evaluate the professors.</strong></li>

<li><strong>While, I would like to say</strong> it is not necessary for children to live far away from home during the school breaks.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> their classmates are their friends and they already spend a lot of time together, you know, they spend 8 hour a day and 5 days a week. And even hang out with other friends at night. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> students are really exhausted by the campus life, because of tons of works and projects and reports. So the school break is the best time for them to relax if they can stay at home all day long.</li>
<li><strong>And another thing that matters is that,</strong> for some students, the school break is the only time that they can spend with their parents.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think it’s not necessary for children to live far away from home during school breaks.</strong></li>

<li><strong>While, I would prefer to</strong> start a project as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> if we start a project as early as possible, and you will stand a fair chance to end this project as early as possible. Because the total time you need to complete the project is constant and not related to the time you start. And you could start the next project immediately, so, you will go to the track of positive circulation, promote the over all efficiency of working.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> if you start a project early, then you have the chance to polish it to the perfect and increase the odds of the real life success.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I stand for the law that always start a project as early as possible.</strong> </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> study for exam in the day. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> You know, I am a morning guy, so, when I get up early, like 6 o’clock or 7 o’clock, I can just get to work immediately. And in the early morning, my mind is really sharp and I can better concentrate on my tasks. And productivity and inventiveness will spring up.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> when I study in the night, I sometimes will pull an all-nighter, and it is definitely detrimental to our body and physical health.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> force myself to do what I am not good at.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> doing something that I am not good at can help me to overcome the fear of unknown and get the gut to step out of the comfort zone. That is definitely crucial for one to abroad the horizon and expand the scope of knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> doing something that you don’t good at can force you to ask others for help. And during this learning process, you can make a great number of friends which are proficient at diverse fields. And such a large interpersonal network is a valuable asset in life (will be a great treasure for the rest of your life).</li>

<li><strong>While, I can not agree that</strong> to succeed we need to make enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Admittedly</strong>, it is true that we will encounter tons of enemies in order to succeed, but it does not mean that we need to make enemies, especially we are already have a lot of enemies.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> the best strategy to succeed is to make friends of an enemy. Which means if you can convert an powerful enemy into friends, that will make you ever stronger and even more closer to the success.</li>
<li><strong>Let’s look at the</strong> Los Angeles Lakers in NBA. Kobe Bryant &amp; Shaquille O’Neal , they are two best players in the whole association. And there is no need for them to be enemy if they want the championship. And when O’Neal left the Lakers, It’s much harder for Kobe to win the championship. </li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I do not agree that we need to make enemies.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While I definitely agree that</strong> good teachers should admit they mistakes or don’t know something.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> every human being will make mistakes, and teacher is no exception. But it is OK to make mistakes, as long as we apologize with sincere attitude, and promise we will never make that mistake again.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong>  Admitting there is something that we don’t know is a excellent chance for teacher to tell  students that knowledge is boundless and infinite and no body is too old to study.</li>

<li><strong>While, I totally not agree that</strong> it’s fine for checking cellphone when crossing roads.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it is definitely a dangerous conduct, because once we dive into our cellphones, there is no chance to obverse the road and spot the dangerous situation and keep away from it. So, the right thing we should do when crossing roads is to slow our speed and check around meticulously.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> if we do so, pedestrians who walking aside will stand a fair chance to emulate our wrong behavior, and it is also perilous for them not to looking at the road, and probably will cause traffic accident.</li>

Please give specific details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> libraries will not disappear, even if more and more people reading in cell phones.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong>, there are still many people are willing to read in paper materials, because paper material has an advantage that could not be replaced by electronic format which is that reading in paper material are more likely to be in progress of deep reading which is immersed in the book.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> libraries also provide all the citizens a quite place to read, if I want to concentrate on my work better at weekend, I could choose to go to city library.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I totally agree that</strong> library computer should be banned from accessing social media websites. </li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the main goal of library computer is to access some specific database that only library have the authority to access. For the sake of safety, the computer shouldn’t be able to connect both specific database and social media in the same time.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I am not agree that</strong> students should take additional courses to get credits more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> students are required to attend three or four courses every semester, and assignment of them are already choking high, so there is no time for them to take the additional courses.</li>

<li><strong>This is because</strong> listening is a excellent chance for everyone to learn from others. If we just talk and talk all the time, there is no chance for us to learn something new. But if we always listen to others’ opinions, we will end up learning numerous ideas that differs from ours’.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I think</strong> universities should wait until the second or the third year before students deciding to choose a major field.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> the university students should be cultivated by a all-rounded way, if a student choose a major field as soon as he enter the university, he would probably directly dive into one direction and just ignore the others, it is not a very wise choice.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> delay the time to decide the major allow students to find their own interest, like, they can sign up a variety field of class and cautiously choose the major afterwards.</li>

<li>I remember that my younger cousin showed a talent in drawing when he was little, so his father, sent him to a school that focus on enhancing the ability of painting. Now he become a famous designer and has created some brilliant projects.</li>

Other people prefer to make friends with people who are of different ages.</h4><p>Which one do you prefer? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make friends with people who are of the same age.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we possibly have the same schedule and we will spend a lot of time together, you know, we are going to the same school, taking the almost the same curriculum, so we almost spend 8 hours a day. That will give us more time to communicate with each other, and get to better know each other.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> we don’t have the generation gap, and we are more easier to understand each other and provide better and pragmatic advises.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to make friends with people who are of the same age.</strong> </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe</strong> libraries will not disappear, even if more and more people reading in cell phones.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong>, there are still many people are willing to read in paper materials, because paper material has an advantage that could not be replaced by electronic format which is that reading in paper material are more likely to be in progress of deep reading which is immersed in the book.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> libraries also provide all the citizens a quite place to read, if I want to concentrate on my work better at weekend, I could choose to go to city library.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think the libraries will no disappear in the future.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Because,</strong> the daytime is the prime time in one day which my mind is sharp and can better concentrate on difficult tasks, and if my professor cancels the class, them I will have an entire morning or entire afternoon to study and prepare the exam because I really want to have the better grade.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> as for shopping, it will be better to shop at night when I am tired and exhausted by the study, I can shift my mind to do something relaxed such as shopping.</li>

<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> it is harder than before to save money.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> nowadays, we are on  a stage that there are so many place for us to spend many than before, <strong>you know,</strong> we have more electronic device to choose, and a lot of attraction to go, and none of them for free. And sometimes we spend money in a impulsive way.</p>

<p><strong>This is because,</strong> a garden can serve more citizens in the community. <strong>You know,</strong> the elders can use this place to relax and teenagers can hang out with each other in this garden.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> the children can also use this garden to play as a playground. In the community I once lived, many parents will bring their children to the community garden to play. So, it is also a nice choice for children.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> participating in team sports is a good way, and maybe the best way to learn team cooperation, especially for the young people.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> teamwork in sports is so important that no one can just win without an excellent cooperation with teammates. </li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> members of a football team need to cooperate to successfully perform a play, whether it be a running play or a passing play. Without all involved in the play working together to make the play happen, the other team could wind up in an ultimate victory.</li>

<li><strong>And besides,</strong> working at home really make me feel comfortable and relaxed. <strong>You know,</strong> I can dress whatever I want, and I don’t need to worry about being interrupt by others.</li>

<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> it is a good idea to get a job under the influence of others.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> if we take the parents idea into consideration, they will give us some precious opinion, because they are more likely to have a deep view of the strengths and weaknesses pf a job.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> the influence from friends also important because we don’t have generation gap, so their suggestions is pragmatic and suitable for me.</p>

Why?</p>
<p><strong>While, I would like to</strong> play inside our house.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> playing inside the house is more safe for everyone, we don’t need to worry about being stolen or robbed, and if somebody left something, it is more likely to get back. And there is little air pollution inside the house.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> I like to play inside because it is more comfortable. You know, there is no need to be well-dressed and have to wear the jacket and tie. We could dressed informal and suit ourselves.</p>

Why?</p>
<p><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> elders should not take risks and participate in adventurous.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> they have to take the safely into consideration, maybe safety is the prime consider for them. Because, compare with the young man, doing the same adventure is more risky for the elders because of their physical status are more fragile and more likely to cause physical deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> my grandpa have a slight cardiac disease, although it is not a big deal, doctor suggest him not to do the strenuous exercises because life always comes first.</p>

<p><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> make a phone call directly.</p>
<p><strong>This is because,</strong> phone calls is more directly and efficient than sending messages. If you want to communicate with or get informations from someone, you could just call them and you will get the answer and whatever you what as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>And besides,</strong> making phone call can reduce the loss of information and misunderstanding. Because, other can quickly find your misunderstanding and misstatement and correct you during the dialogue in a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I prefer to choose the phone call.</strong></p>

<li><strong>While,</strong> when I disagree with my friends or family, I tend to let them keep their own opinion.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> we are different person with different background, we could not totally agree with each other on everything. So, if we try hard to convince others, we may often slide into drastic argument or even fierce fight, and sometimes end up with nothing. </li>
<li><strong>And as for me,</strong> I think distinctly express my opinion is important, but getting involved in an argument which meant to convince others are meaningless and just the waste of time.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I would like to let them keep their own opinion.</strong></li>

<p><strong>This is because,</strong> it is more convenient for elders to be taught. You know, some of the elders are not capable of leaving home because of some specific health conditions. So, it is more possible for them to be taught at home.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> we should not discuss about the celebrities’ private activities.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> their private activities are none of my business, and their private activities are undoubtedly their privacy, and paying too much attention to their privacy will possibly cross the line and break the law.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> staying out of their personal life can help me better focus on their works. You know, when I watch a movie I really want to do deep in to the character they play not be entangled by their anecdotes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> students learn more effectively through doing other activities such as subject report.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> these kind of report or papers will give us a chance to deeply understanding the field or subject in a thorough and well-rounded way. But taking exams will limit us to study some key point which gonna be tested and ignore the others. </li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> completing a project will allow us to study under less pressure than the exams. And a relaxation and happiness will help us to enjoy the research which lead to high efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I prefer to do other activities than exams.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Honestly, I think</strong> television <strong>has a positive influence</strong> on society. </li>
<li><strong>First of all</strong>, it can help people to relax. <strong>I mean</strong> people can watch some comedies or other programs that can make them laugh and forget about the troubles and stress. </li>
<li><strong>And also</strong> TV is important because it can help people to learn new skills. <strong>You know</strong> <strong>nowadays</strong> many people learn how to cook on TV,  they learn how to speak English on TV. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I would like to</strong> take courses that are from a variety of subjects areas, </li>
<li><strong>because</strong> this can help me to make more friends. <strong>You know,</strong> I can meet people from different fields and get to know them, so this can help me to build a large network. </li>
<li><strong>And besides, I like to</strong> take courses from different subject areas because many subjects fascinate me a lot. I mean sometimes I am just fascinated by math courses, and sometimes I get to learn about the history, and then I get to learn about something about arts.

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think</strong> studying on-line <strong>is actually better.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because, personally,</strong> I  can study better on the Internet. <strong>This is because</strong> on-line lessons could be replaced for as many times as I want to. So, I can watch it over and over again until I understand all the key points.</li>
<li><strong>Besides, I would like to study on-line, because it</strong> really saves time. I mean with on-line courses, I can just stay at home. So I don’t need to spend any time traveling to the school. And in this way, I can just spend that time to do something that I like. </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I personally think</strong> that learning art and literature <strong>is, actually more important.</strong></li>
<li><strong>because,</strong> when learning arts we get to study music, and it can help us to relax. <strong>I mean,</strong> whenever we feel tired, we can just play a beautiful piece of melody, which can help us to empty our mind. </li>
<li><strong>Beside, the reason why I think</strong> study literature <strong>is important is that</strong> through study these subject, we can actually learn some foreign culture.

<ul>
<li><strong>Well, I think it is better to do</strong> different kinds of works at different points of life.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> it allows me to learn a lot of skills. For example, if I do a customer service job, I can learn how to communicate with people and how to solve problems efficiently. And if I do, <strong>lets say,</strong> accountant job, I can just learn how to deal with numbers. So this can help me a lot.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> doing different jobs helps me to make friends. Because I can meet different people at different work, and we can become close with each other.</li>

Use specific details and reasons in your response.</p>
<ul>
<li>While, I don’t think parents should help their kids to choose the university.</li>
<li>Because, parents usually don’t know what are their children really want. You know, they and their kids always are aiming to different things. Maybe their kids focus on the major that they like, but the parents will think about something different, such as their career, their jobs or their opportunities, even including their salaries, staff like that. That why, if their parents help them to choose the university, I think they may end up arguing. They may argue about what, you know, what to study, or where to go.</li>
<li>So, because of this, it is better that parents just stay out.</li>

Use specific reasons and details in your response.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> the advertisements for candy or junk food should not be shown on the television.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> young people, their are quite impulsive and sometimes can not recognize what is good or what is bad for them. So, if there are a lot of advertisements for French fries, or hamburgers, they are more likely to be influenced, you know, their might eat this kind of food everyday complement with coca cola. That is really bad for their health. Not to mention that, junk foods are full of fat which may lead to weight problems or even heart problems.</li>
<li><strong>So, that’s why they should not be shown.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I would like to</strong> study in a quite place, you know, just by myself.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong> it is actually really quite and I can better focus myself. You know, I don’t have to worry about like others distracting me at all. <strong>So, in this case,</strong> I can just cope with my work efficiently and finish my work very quickly.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> when I study in somewhere just by myself such as home, I can be very comfortable. I can dress comfortably and do whatever I want. I can even eat when I am studying.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I believe that</strong> it was much easier to eat healthy food in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> the environment is better, <strong>you know</strong>, there was no pollution, so the water was clean, the air was clear. So the food we ate was generally much healthier.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> in the past, people have more time to cook <em>at home</em>. So, the meal they had was healthy because they could make the dinner <em>complement with vegetables</em>. But nowadays, since people are busy, they just rely heavily on fast food which is not healthy at all.</li>

<li><strong>But,</strong> if the private car are not allowed, and people work in the city center could use the public transit, so, without a lot of private cars, the bus can move freely and easily, so it’s a win-win strategy because everyone can arrive their destination much faster.</li>

Other people prefer to shop in small specialty stores.</h4><p>Which do you prefer? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li>While, I would like to shop in large places.</li>
<li>Because, I can save money in this way. You know, this large grocery store often have better deals and sometimes decide to sell of part of their goods. So, they can offer better price for me. So, I can save the money and use the money to do something I like such as watching movies or buying books.</li>
<li>And besides, I would like to shop in large places, because it’s convenient. You know, it has almost everything I need. So, I can get all the stuff in my shopping list in one place. So, it can really save a lot of time.</li>
<li>Therefore, I like to shop in large places.</li>

Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I do believe that</strong> students should be allowed to choose their own seat. <strong>I mean,</strong> they can sit in different seats on different days.</li>
<li><strong>Because</strong>, this can help them to make more friends. <strong>Because</strong>, by sitting in different seats in classroom, he can just get to know different people, <strong>and in this case,</strong> he can be friends with them and they can have a lot of fun together.</li>
<li><strong>And beside,</strong> by sitting in different places, he may have to work with different person on class team projects. <strong>In this way,</strong> he can improve his communication skills and cultivate the sense of confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, student should be able to choose the seat.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While, I prefer to</strong> have a wide variety of friends.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> This is really exciting. <strong>I mean,</strong> when I hang out with different group of people, I get to do different things. <strong>Like,</strong> if I hang out with friends who like movies, we can talk about movies all day. And when I meeting the friends who are interested in books, I will eager to share my point of view such as the characteristic of the protagonist in The Great Gatsby. <strong>So,</strong> by having a great variety of friends can really bring joy to my life.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> I get to learn something new from different people all the time too.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, these are the reason why I would like to have a wide variety of friends.</strong></li>

Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I don’t think</strong> eighteen-year-olds are mature enough to vote.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> I think they are easily influenced by their parents. <strong>I mean,</strong> most of them still live at home, and they may listen to what their parents says. <strong>As the result,</strong> their vote might present their parents’ preferences, not their own.</li>
<li><strong>And also,</strong> eighteen-year-olds are high school students in my country, facing the graduation examination, they are very busy. They probably have to study over 8 to 10 hours a day, <strong>so,</strong> I don’t think they have enough time to be familiar with the politics. So, because of these, they really couldn’t cast a vote.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, because of there two reasons, I think they are not mature enough to vote.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While I do believe that</strong> people will enjoy themselves better at concerts or films if they have their friends with them.</li>
<li><strong>This is because</strong> they can totally spread the joy. Because one of the main purpose for me to go to concerts is to strengthen my contact with my friends, you know, when we all listen to a concert, we are all immersed in a harmonious atmosphere which is better for us to spread the joy.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> if I have friends around me after the movie, I will eager to share my point of view of the movie.</li>
<li><strong>So, that’s why I can better enjoy myself at concerts or films if I go with a bunch of my friends.</strong></li>

Others prefer to save the extra money.</h4><p>Which do you like to do? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, I am the kind of person who</strong> will spend the money right away.</li>
<li><strong>Because,</strong> this can make me feel happy. <strong>For example,</strong> if I buy a very nice outfit, I can receive a lot of compliments of my friends. You know, that will make me feel more proud and make me more confident.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> I would like to spend my money right away, because this kind of actions can really motivate me to earn more money. So, I will be motivated by my self to do more hours in my part-time job or just to take on some extra projects to earn the money. So, in this case, it motivate me to work hard.</li>
<li><strong>So, because of these two reasons, I would like to spend the money right away.</strong></li>

Other people disagree."></a>【TPO 54】Some people say that childhood is the best time in a person’s life. Other people disagree.</h4><p>What is your opinion? Explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>While, actually, I do agree that</strong> childhood is the best time in one’s life.</li>
<li><strong>This is because,</strong> children have a lot of vacations, in my country, students have summer and winter vacations which last one and half long. So, usually, students can use the vacation to go on a trip, or they can do the things that they like.</li>
<li><strong>And besides,</strong> I think childhood is the best time, <strong>because</strong> children don’t have much heavy responsibility. <strong>I mean,</strong> they don’t have to look after their parents and certainly they don’t have to take care of their children. <strong>So, in this case,</strong> they have less stresses.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, I think childhood is actually the best of in one’s life.</strong></li>
